## What is this?

tl;dr This is where I'll post some of my writing, mostly based around criticism
and critical thinking.

I started keeping a regular, personal journal during my senior year in high
school. I did this for a variety of reasons: I thought it would improve my
writing, and I had read that it was ["good for you"][lh_journaling_benefits].

This is not my journal.

... but at that point I set a precedent for writing regularly. The summer after
my senior year in high school I started writing about movies I had seen, because
I always forgot them and thought writing my thoughts would be useful.

This was my introduction to criticism. Initially, my movie "reviews" were just a
few sentences like "It was good movie and I liked it." Over time, my critiques
developed, and I began to expand beyond film into writing about books.
Separately, during my sophomore year in college, I became more interested in
critical thinking, and evaluating claims logically and rationally.

At this point (beginning of 2016), I feel like I've developed my writing enough
that I'd like to start circulating it more widely, so I've taken the full plunge
and decided to post it completely in public on the Internet. Make no mistake: I
am not qualified be a professional critic, but I believe my views are sometimes
unique and—I hope one day—will become insightful.

## Who are you?

I grew up in Massachusetts, went to school at the University of Michigan, and
now I work in the bay area as a software
["engineer"][programmers_arent_engineers].

I'm interested in criticism, critical thinking, rationality, skepticism,
relationships, and disagreements (especially ones [that shouldn't
happen][aumanns_agreement_thm]).
