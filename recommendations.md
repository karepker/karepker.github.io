title: Recommendations
---

I wanted to take some space and recommend a few of the things I've
read/seen/experienced. To avoid adding to this list impulsively, I'll only add
an item here if I still consider it important after a year.

## Perspective changing

These are works that had an enormous influence on my thinking and interests.

* <del>[_Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_][methods]</del>: When I
  first found _Methods_, I couldn't stop reading it; I blew through the first
  ~1500 pages in two weeks during my sophomore year in college. By the time I
  had finished all available chapters, _Methods_ had sparked my interest in
  rationality, critical thinking, philosophy, and skepticism. While rereading it
  after its completion in 2015, however, I started noting some red flags, which
  were later confirmed and instantiated when I discovered [su3su2u1's posts
  about _Methods_][su3su2u1_methods_posts], which point out deep problems with
  both its goals and execution. What was once my most enthusiastic
  recommendation is now my most ambivalent, but I keep _Methods_ on this list
  because of it is the most important work I've ever read.
* [Harry Plinkett's reviews][youtube_plinkett_playlist]: Before watching
  Plinkett's reviews, I thought criticism was mostly touchy-feely garbage
  written by cynical hipsters. Plinkett's reviews showed me that criticism could
  be concrete, and gives me an example I strive to match in quality when I
  critique. His reviews are also hilariously done in character as a senile,
  homicidal man. ([TW][ssc_triggers]: implied violence against women.)

## Well argued

While these works didn't necessarily change my perspective, I find them
exceptionally well argued.

* [The Categories Were Made for Man, Not Man for the Categories][ssc_trans]:
  Scott Alexander's post in support of trans individuals and for interpreting
  gender as a self-identified category is one of my favorite posts on his site,
  and a model for any social arguments I'd want to make.
* [Blame][radiolab_blame]: I love Radiolab's style of making abstract issues
  concrete through stories. In this episode, I find the last story to be a good
  reminder that forgiveness and empathy toward the other side can be more
  constructive than blind hatred.
* [How We All Miss the Point on School Shootings][mark_manson_school_shootings]:
  Mark Manson cuts through the politicization of school shootings to argue that
  their root cause is a culture in which honest relationships are taboo. (TW:
  violence, misogyny.)
* [Why Go Is Not Good][why_go_is_not_good]: Criticism is not limited to art.
  This piece on the Go language interests me both as a programmer and a critic.
* [How Apple and Amazon Security Flaws Led to My Epic
  Hacking][wired_mat_honan_hacking]: Finger-pointing headline aside, this story
  demonstrated to me how vulnerable we are online, and that we can be hacked for
  the most arbitrary reasons. After reading it upon its publication in 2012, I
  turned on two factor authentication everywhere I could. This isn't a perfect
  solution, but it can go a long way toward solving the problem.
