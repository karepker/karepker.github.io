title: Recommendations

I wanted to take some space and recommend a few of the things I've
read/seen/experienced. To avoid adding to this list impulsively, I'll only add
an item here if I still consider it important after a year.

## Perspective changing

These are works that had an enormous influence on my thinking and interests.

* ~~[_Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_][methods]~~: When I first
  found _Methods_, I couldn't stop reading it; I blew through the first ~1500
  pages in two weeks during my sophomore year in college. By the time I had
  finished all that was available chapters, _Methods_ had sparked my interest in
  rationality, critical thinking, philosophy, and skepticism. While rereading it
  after its completion in 2015, however, I began to pick up on red flags, which
  were later confirmed and instantiated when I discovered [su3su2u1's
  review][su3su2u1_methods_review], which points out the deep problems with both
  the goals and execution of _Methods_. What was once my most enthusiastic
  recommendation is now my most ambivalent, but I keep _Methods_ on this list
  because of its undeniable initial impact on me.
* [Harry Plinkett's reviews][youtube_plinkett_playlist]: Before watching
  Plinkett's reviews, I thought criticism was mostly touchy-feely garbage
  written by cynical hipsters. Plinkett's reviews showed me that criticism could
  be concrete, and gives me an example I strive to match in quality when I
  critique. His reviews are also hilariously done in character as a senile,
  homicidal man. (TW: implied violence against women.)

## Well argued

While these works didn't necessarily change my perspective, I find them
exceptionally well argued.

* [The Categories Were Made for Man, Not Man for the Categories][ssc_trans]: I
  often find Scott Alexander's work at SlateStarCodex very well-argued, but this
  essay is one of my favorites. In it, Scott builds an argument for trans
  individuals by explaining that gender self-identification is redrawing
  boundaries to increase happiness, not an issue of "truth".
* [Blame][radiolab_blame]: Perhaps it's a bit of a misnomer to place a Radiolab
  episode under a section called "Well argued", because Radiolab rarely argues,
  preferring to tell stories to make issues concrete. "Blame", my favorite
  Radiolab episode, finishes with a story about the power of forgiveness and
  empathy in connecting people who have every reason to hate each other.
* [How We All Miss the Point on School Shootings][mark_manson_school_shootings]:
  Mark Manson is probably best known for his dating advice about building
  healthy relationships through shared vulnerability. In this essay, he branches
  out a little, cutting through the politicization of school shootings to argue
  that by truly caring for and being interested in others, we might be able to
  stop some of the violence.
