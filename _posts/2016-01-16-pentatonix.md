_Pentatonix_ surprises me. For years, [Pentatonix has talked about their goal to
release an all original album][ptx_des_moines_register]: a goal they finally
realized with the release of _Pentatonix_. Pentatonix
[claimed][ptx_yahoo_interview] that 2015 was the right time to release an
all-original album, place their covers in the background, and develop what they
have to say as an artist.

I'm not too concerned with what Pentatonix has to say, but rather the manner in
which they say it. _Pentatonix_ is a pop album. Not a pop-influenced album, not
a contemporary a cappella album in a pop style. A pop album. While some reviews,
including those from the [New York Times][nytimes_review] and [Rolling
Stone][rolling_stone_review] have hinted at this aspect of _Pentatonix_, I'd
like to take some time to really argue and explore this in depth.

I'm not going to define pop theoretically, but I consider pop essentially to be
some "average" of the music and production techniques used in top 40 music in
the last five years. I don't want to give a theoretical definition of pop
because I think trying to coerce _Pentatonix_ into that definition won't be very
successful or readable. My music theory knowledge is limited; my music
production knowledge is limited, but [I have listened to a lot of
Pentatonix][my_last_fm_pentatonix], and I've listened to enough pop to notice
_Pentatonix_'s similarities to it. My argument that _Pentatonix_ is a pop album,
then, will be more bottom-up: I'll compare _Pentatonix_ to the Pentatonix's
previous work as well as pop songs from other artists and explain the
differences and similarities.

## Who?

For those who are unfamiliar with the group, Pentatonix is a five person a
cappella group composed of members Scott Hoying (baritone), Mitch Grassi
(tenor), Kirstie Maldonado (alto), Avi Kaplan (bass), and Kevin Olusola (vocal
percussion). They [won Season 3 of NBC's _The Sing Off_][sing_off_s3] shortly
after assembling themselves in 2011. Over the past four years, they've developed
a loyal fanbase [through judicious use of social
media][social_media_powerhouse], especially Youtube, released five albums, and
[signed with RCA][ptx_rca_signed].

## "Pop?"

### Multitracking

Perhaps the most noticeable change in _Pentatonix_ when compared to their other
albums is the addition of quite a bit of multitracking: recording one person
over themselves. A few examples:

1. Scott's harmonization with himself in the [second verse of "New Year's
   Day"][ptx_new_years_day_scott_self_harmonization].
1. Kirstie's ad lib additions over her voice in the [last chorus of
   "Water"][ptx_water_kirstie_ad_lib].
1. Miscellaneous background "ahhs" above the three-part solo harmony in the
   ["Sing" chorus][ptx_sing_ahhs].


Multitracking can be used to good effect. [Home Free][home_free_youtube], season
4 winners of _The Sing-Off_ and also a five member a cappella group, uses
multitracking often in their albums, most noticeably when Tim Foust, their bass,
has a solo (["I've Seen"][home_free_ive_seen_tim_multitrack], ["Champagne Taste
on a Beer Budget"][home_free_champagne_taste_tim_multitrack], ["Friends in Low
Places"][home_free_friends_in_low_places_tim_multitrack]). But while Home Free
uses multitracking to in the studio to make up for a lack of voices,  Pentatonix
uses it to add pop flourishes. Ad libbing over a final chorus brings to mind
songs by modern pop icons Kelly Clarkson (["Heartbeat
Song"][heartbeat_song_ad_lib]) or Rihanna (["You Da One"][you_da_one_ad_lib]).
Self-harmonization brings similar associations to mind (["Heartbeat Song" ...
again][heartbeat_song_self_harmonization], Maroon 5 -
["Payphone"][payphone_self_harmonization]).

The use of such extensive and obvious multitracking in _Pentatonix_ departs from
Pentatonix's previous studio sound. The only examples of multitracking in their
previous albums are subtle. Mitch ad libs over himself singing in the background
at the [end of "Hark the Herald Angels
Sing"][ptx_hark_the_herald_angels_mitch_ad_lib] and in ["Angels We Have Heard On
High"][ptx_angels_we_have_heard_mitch_ad_lib] in the albums _That's Christmas To
Me_ and _PTXMas_, respectively. Other multitracking examples from previous
albums, if they exist, are similarly subtle; unlike Home Free, Pentatonix, in
the past, would shift parts rather than multitrack them. For example, when Avi,
Pentatonix's bass, sings leads in ["Standing by"][ptx_standing_by] and ["Most
Wonderful Time of the Year"][ptx_most_wonderful_time_of_the_year], I hear
Scott's distinct timbre on the bass line.

### Vocal manipulation

#### Kirstie's solos

Pop elements are not only present through the addition of more tracks but also
through manipulation of existing tracks, especially in Kirstie’s solos.

Though Kirstie has a sweet voice, she is often overshadowed by the raw talent of
Pentatonix's other singing members: [Scott's wide range and charismatic
lead][scott_i_should_tell_your_momma], [Mitch's pure-toned high
tenor][superfruit_defying_gravity], and [Avi's powerful
bass][avi_if_i_were_the_king]. That said, Kirstie's voice proves a valuable
addition to the group, [she blends well with Mitch when singing
harmonies][ptx_you_da_one_mitch_kirstie_blend], and her unpretentious voice
[fits certain songs very well][ptx_daft_punk_digital_love].

_Pentatonix_ completely distorts Kirstie's voice. Rather than a sweet tone, I
hear a nasal tone lacking support, something I associate with the [overproduced,
plastic, sexy-pop-star aesthetic][britney_spears_3], not a [former musical
theatre student][ptx_bio]. Yes, good singers have the ability to color their
voices in different ways, but this tone only seems to appear when Kirstie takes
the solo, e.g. [her verse in "Ref"][ptx_ref_kirstie_verse] or
["Water"][ptx_water]. While in the background, her voice seems untampered,
suggesting production wizardry as the culprit.

#### Effects

Beyond the vocal manipulation of Kirstie's voice in "Water", I hear a lower,
doubled octave when she sings ["Timid heart/Hide my
scars"][ptx_water_timid_heart]. The same effect is applied on Scott's [first
verse in "Ref"][ptx_ref_first_verse]. While an argument could be made that this
counts as multitracking, I consider this an effect because the intent is
different. Whereas multitracking is a production technique to fill in additional
parts, adding a lower doubled octave is a mixing technique [to make vocal tracks
sound fuller][octave_doubling_example]. Also, in Kirstie's case, it seems likely
that her solo in its original octave was pitch-shifted down, not multitracked.
If Kirstie did sing the lower octave, she would have had to hit a B♭2, unlikely
considering [her lowest recorded note is an E3][kirstie_range].

I also hear the use of a complementary studio technique that makes a group sound
bigger on this album. For example, the "ahhh"s above the chorus of "Sing" sound
full and airy, like a well-blended choir, or perhaps the backing vocals in
10cc's ["I'm Not in Love"][10cc_im_not_in_love]. Whatever the name of the effect
applied, its result is that I can no longer pick out individual voices backing
the "ahhhs". Any individuality that the voices possessed has been stripped, a
casualty of the quest for pop sound.

This anonymity of voices is not limited to "Sing". The same effect can be found
when listening to the backing ["whoa oh oh oh"
line][ptx_first_things_first_whoa_oh] in "First Things First", which sounds like
it's coming from a group much larger than Pentatonix. I hear Avi's voice, but
cannot tell which other members of Pentatonix sing the line.

It's worth noting that the 2015 A Cappella Academy Choir is credited for
provided backing vocals on 6/13 tracks on the album's standard edition. The A
Cappella Academy Choir's [far greater number of voices
][aca_2015_choir_new_years_day] might explain why backing vocals often sound as
though they are supported by a large group, but the choir does not receive
credit on either "Sing" or "First Things First".

It's not the effects themselves that make Pentatonix pop, but the way they are
used. In the past, Pentatonix used clever arranging techniques to present a
fuller sound; their use of effects was subtle. In _Pentatonix_, the balance
seems to have shifted: the effects create a fuller sound.

### Vocal Percussion Simplification

More subtle but equally important is _Pentatonix_'s treatment of vocal
percussion. Kevin's a great vocal percussionist, and [he and Avi work together
to form a rhythm section][kevin_avi_rhythm].

This makes me wonder then, why his contributions on _Pentatonix_ are so
marginalized and mechanized that Kevin's distinctive voiced ["oo!"][kevin_oo]s
disappear, replaced with a generic pop beat. Consider ["Can't Sleep
Love"][ptx_cant_sleep_love], Pentatonix's debut single from the album. [Kevin's
line consists almost entirely of "boots" and "cats"][ptx_cant_sleep_love_kevin],
the first sounds [an amateur would learn to make][ptx_blue_peter]. Other tracks
on the album consist of similarly rudimentary beatbox technique. Kevin does
augment some of his simplistic lines [when performing
live][ptx_cant_sleep_love_live], but they still feel very repetitive compared to
the amazing work he does, for example, in [Pentatonix's live "NSYNC
Medley"][ptx_nsync].

_Pentatonix_ is—of course—[not the only a cappella album that suffers from
generic vocal percussion][silhooettes_playing_with_lightning_rarb], but normally
I don't associate this type of vocal percussion sound with a professional group,
rather with an amateur group lacking an experienced vocal percussionist.

That's not to say that all the vocal percussion on this album sounds
pop-productionized. I like [the groove Kevin sets in "First Things
First"][ptx_first_things_first_groove], and admire the diversity of sounds [he
uses in the bridge of the same song][ptx_first_things_first_kevin_bridge].

### Collaborations

#### On the album

After Pentatonix won _The Sing-Off_, they were signed and then [dropped by
Sony's Epic Records][ptx_wsj]. After being dropped, they found success
on Youtube through a series of viral covers, accumulating [more views and
subscribers][ptxofficial_youtube_stats] than [Beyoncé][beyonce_youtube_stats].
In the past, Pentatonix has collaborated with other Youtube stars: Todrick Hall
(["Wizard of Ahhhs"][ptx_wizard_of_ahhhs]), Lindsey Stirling
(["Radioactive"][ptx_radioactive] and ["Papaoutai"][ptx_papaoutai]), and Tori
Kelly (["Walkin' in a Winter Wonderland/Don't Worry, Be
Happy"][ptx_walkin_dont_worry]).

The only collaboration on this album is with Jason Derulo in ["If I Ever Fall in
Love"][ptx_if_i_ever_fall_in_love]. Derulo signed to minor recording label
Beluga Heights, later bought by Warner Music Group, through which he released
his debut single ["Whatcha Say"][jason_derulo_whatcha_say]
([citation][jason_derulo_wiki]). "Whatcha Say" [charted number one on the
Billboard Hot 100][jason_derulo_whatcha_say_billboard].

The link between Derulo's pop roots with his performance in "If I Ever Fall in
Love" is tenuous, if it exists at all. I brought his background up, though, to
point out Pentatonix's pop aspirations, which I also see reflected in their
changing Youtube strategy. Pentatonix has been transitioning away from the
Youtube world for some time now. Since being signed by RCA, they've posted one
live cover to Youtube (["Evolution of Michael Jackson"][ptx_michael_jackson]),
choosing to focus more on professionally produced music videos to go alongside
their studio recorded tracks. _Pentatonix_ comes with no promises to renew their
original, refreshingly raw Youtube strategy. While they pay some homage to their
Youtube roots in [the music video for "Sing"][ptx_sing], which features clips
from Youtube-famous celebrities (e.g. Tyler Oakley and Grace Helbig) this is
mostly fan-service with no concrete backing. Their channel now functions more as
an afterthought than the source of their music, mirroring what more established
pop stars might do.

#### Behind the scenes

Looking behind the scenes further reveals the pop roots from which _Pentatonix_
was born. Pentatonix and representatives [reached out top songwriters and
producers][ptx_songwriter_interview]. In the end, songwriters including Audra
Mae ([writing credits for Kelly Clarkson, Miranda Lambert,
Avicii][audra_mae_writing_credits]), Taylor Parks ([Ariana Grande, Jennifer
Lopez, Fifth Harmony][taylor_parks_writing_credits]), and Sam Hollander ([Katy
Perry, Train, Neon Trees][sam_hollander_writing_credits]) receive writing
credits on _Pentatonix_ alongside the five members of the group. Each
songwriter, according to Pentatonix, came in to ["mediate and teach [them] the
ways"][ptx_usa_today_interview]. Of course, this is not the first time
Pentatonix has worked with professional songwriters. _PTX, Vol III_ [gives
external writing credits][ptx_vol_iii_wiki] for both "On My Way Home" and "See
Through", but _Pentatonix_ increases the amount of collaboration by an order of
magnitude.

Beyond songwriting, the group worked with pop producer Kuk Harrell ([vocal
production credits for Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Katy
Perry][kuk_harrell_credits]). After a positive first session, [they decided to
continue working with him][ptx_amazon_interview]. As a result, Harrell receives
vocal production credits for 9/13 songs on the standard edition of the album.
[Pentatonix credits Harrell][ptx_songwriter_interview] for bringing their sound
closer to the mainstream.

### Arranging style

The most nebulous aspect of this album probably strikes me the most about it.
While on _The Sing-Off_ and in their early live Youtube covers, Pentatonix
developed a distinct arranging style: Avi and Kevin formed a strong rhythm and
bass section that filled the mix, Scott would sing the solo, and Mitch and
Kirstie would provide tight harmonies. Despite doing this every week, this
simple style allowed—perhaps even forced—Pentatonix to take huge risks when
arranging. Their ability to to change up songs—skipping like a record in ["Video
Killed the Radio Star"][ptx_video_killed_the_radio_star], adding a reggae bridge
to ["Stuck Like Glue"][ptx_stuck_like_glue], harmonizing rap lyrics in ["Thrift
Shop"][ptx_thrift_shop] and ["Can't Hold Us"][ptx_cant_hold_us], or adding
rhythmic synchronization to ["We Are Young"][ptx_we_are_young]—garnered them
critical acclaim both on _The Sing Off_ for their [futuristic style of a
cappella][ptx_from_the_future], and for the albums they released after it,
[especially _PTX, Vol. 1_][casa_2013w].

Pentatonix began to lose their arranging spark around their rather derivative
arrangement of Clean Bandit's ["Rather Be"][ptx_rather_be] and the uninspired
original ["See Through"][ptx_see_through] in _PTX, Vol. III_. _Pentatonix_'s
similarly uniteresting ["Misbehavin'"][ptx_misbehavin],
["Cracked"][ptx_cracked], ["Water"][ptx_water], and even Pentatonix's debut
single ["Can't Sleep Love"][ptx_cant_sleep_love] seem to lack the special spark
that makes a Pentatonix arrangement so compelling. Whereas Pentatonix used to
bend the rules to change existing music, it feels as if someone told the group
not to stray too far from the pop formula.

On the other hand, some of _Pentatonix_'s tracks are a complete break with the
arranging style I associate with the group. Consider the "oh" chorus backing
Scott throughout ["Rose Gold"][ptx_rose_gold] or the similar "wah"s in
["Ref"][ptx_ref]. I can't file these under a specific pop trope, but they bear
mention as part of the overall shift toward pop music adopted by _Pentatonix_.

In fact, the most old-Pentatonix moment I heard comes at the end the deluxe
edition of album's ["Cheerleader"][ptx_cheerleader]. They sing the final chorus
in a [three part harmony with a complex bass line][ptx_cheerleader_harmony]. The
moment I'd been waiting for during the whole album lasts only 15 seconds.

## Why?

I know Pentatonix can still create novel, compelling arrangements that stay true
to their style just based on the three part harmony they move into after the
bridge of "Cheerleader". Why don't they, then? A naive answer might blame
_Pentatonix_'s all-original nature, its most apparent difference from previous
albums. Pentatonix has released previous original work. In fact, ["Baddest
Girl"][ptx_baddest_girl] and ["Show You How to Love"][ptx_show_you_how_to_love]
from _PTX, Vol. 1_ continue to be among my favorite Pentatonix songs of all
time.

I'd point to the context of this album as the culprit for its sound. As I
mentioned, Pentatonix worked with pop songwriters and producers to create this
album. Coming from a pop background, these behind the scenes creators of
_Pentatonix_ likely had a huge influence on the sound of the album.

All this said, placing responsibility for the sound of this album only on the
external songwriters, the producers, or the other people involved behind the
scenes denies Pentatonix agency. Pentatonix is mature enough to stick to their
artistic vision. They've received plenty of pressure over the years to migrate
away from a cappella music, but [have chosen to stick to their a cappella
roots][ptx_wsj].

On the other hand, Pentatonix has also [craved mainstream
attention][ptx_billboard]. Understanding the tension between these two
conflicting interests elucidates the motivation behind _Pentatonix_: Pentatonix
_wanted_ a pop sound for this album. They knew that only a pop album would get
them radio airplay and launch them into national recognition.

## Is _Pentatonix_ a contemporary a cappella album?

I've spent the previous sections talking about how _Pentatonix_ is a pop album:
it uses pop production techniques, was written with pop songwriters, was
produced by pop professionals with a pop audience and pop goals in mind. To look
on the other side of the genre coin, is it still fair to call _Pentatonix_
contemporary a cappella? I know, the definition of a cappella is essentially
"without instruments", and _Pentatonix_ meets this criterion.

I think this definition is a little reductive, though. Contemporary a cappella
music has developed its own sound, a sound very different from other forms of a
cappella, such as sacred hymns. To continue to classify a cappella as simply
"without instruments" denies contemporary a cappella identity as a genre. With
this frame of reference, I don't think we can consider _Pentatonix_ contemporary
a cappella.

Pop and contemporary a cappella are not mutually exclusive categories. In fact,
I'd say that the majority of scholastic groups and semi-professional and
professional groups have a pop focus. Taken as a whole, however, contemporary a
cappella groups employ a wide range of techniques and arrangements: from a
"listen to a song, identify parts, and transcribe them for voice" approach to an
approach that seeks inspiration from different genres and pushes the boundaries
of the human voice.

There is a difference though, between pop albums and contemporary a cappella
albums with a pop focus. To illustrate the difference, I think it's constructive
to compare _Pentatonix_ to the [critically acclaimed][casa_2014w] 2013 album
_Bioluminescence_ from ARORA (née Sonos). ARORA [says][arora_about] about
_Bioluminescence_, "Two years in the making, 'Bioluminescence' perfectly
demonstrates the cinematic dream pop sound that is ARORA, marrying dreamy vocals
with striking production." Indeed, listening to _Bioluminescence_, it's easy to
hear the use of many production effects, sometimes so many that the voices
behind the effects are nearly impossible to discern (["Lock the
Light"][arora_lock_the_light]). I would still consider _Bioluminescence_ to be
contemporary a cappella, though.

The difference between _Bioluminescence_ and _Pentatonix_ is not the amount of
voice production, but its purpose. The members of ARORA uses the studio to clean
up the sound from their trademark looping and effects pedals, creating a more
meaningful illusion. _Pentatonix_ uses studio effects to bend the human voice
closer to the existing mainstream pop sound. This creates a convincing pop album
free of vocal artifacts that might turn off listeners unfamiliar with the genre.

I don't want to claim that either Pentatonix or ARORA uses effects for a nobler
cause. I like songs on _Bioluminescence_ and _Pentatonix_ for different reasons.
I love the bass groove, haunting melody, and shimmering background vocals in
["Silver Hand"][arora_silver_hand] on _Bioluminescence_. I also love the catchy
hook in ["Sing"][ptx_sing] and introspective and yearning ["New Year's
Day"][ptx_new_years_day] on _Pentatonix_, but I love them as pop songs, not as
contemporary a cappella songs.

Admitting that Pentatonix has crafted a pop album forces us to reevaluate
_Pentatonix_ in a different context. Initially, Pentatonix's appeal was niche,
they competed—literally—against other a cappella groups in _The Sing-Off_. Over
the past several years, the group has vied for a broader audience's attention.
Undeniably, they have succeeded, and now count [a Grammy][ptx_grammy_page] and
[a tour with pop star Kelly Clarkson][ptx_kelly_clarkson_tour_announce] as
notches in their belt. With [_Pentatonix_'s debut at number 1 on the Billboard
Hot 100][pentatonix_billboard_no1], they have cemented themselves as a player in
the pop world. By being so anxious to transcend their a cappella beginnings,
however, Pentatonix may have sacrificed the feature that would make them unique
in an oversaturated pop market.

To move beyond the group, considering _Pentatonix_ as a pop album has subtle but
important effects on the rest of the contemporary a cappella community. In the
past, Pentatonix has been hailed as the group that would bring contemporary a
cappella to the mainstream, giving it legitimacy as an art form [previously
unrecognized by modern audiences][ptx_billboard]. With their wide exposure,
Pentatonix has the ability to inspire the next generation of singers, both in
and outside the contemporary a cappella world.

What does it mean though, when the U.S.'s best known contemporary a cappella
group releases a pop album? My fear is that equating success in contemporary a
cappella with pop limits the scope of future a cappella. As I've said, pop does
play a huge role in contemporary a cappella, but some of the most interesting a
cappella releases eschew pop. As an example, I point to the [critically
acclaimed][casa_2012w], delightfully strange, experimental [self-titled
EP][boxettes_boxettes] by the now-defunct Boxettes. This album would sound very
different were its creators convinced that their end goal was pop.

To be fair, the opposite could happen as well. _Pentatonix_ could draw in those
who would be otherwise uninterested in a cappella. Upon entering the community,
these members might realize the range of music opportunities contemporary a
cappella offers extends beyond pop.

Regardless of uncertainties surrounding _Pentatonix_'s impact on the genre and
community, the group's pop ambitions are still grounded in one concrete reality:
the need to perform live. While I wouldn't go so far as to call live
performances the arbiter of a cappella, a cappella is born out of live
performance, and [even groups known for their use of effects in the studio (e.g.
Naturally 7)][naturally7_tom_anderson_effects] must come to terms with the
reality of touring. On tour, the songs in _Pentatonix_ will lack any studio
polish and the careful touch of an engineer. By Pentatonix's [own admission,
they have some work to do][ptx_figure_out_sing_live] when figuring out how to
perform some of their originals live. This challenge also presents an
opportunity: when Pentatonix moves their originals from the studio to the stage,
they'll have to be creative and to work within limitations. In doing this, I
hope they rediscover what made them my favorite group in the first place.

## Appendix A: Liner Notes

Unfortunately, the complete liner notes for _Pentatonix_ are not available
anywhere else on the Internet, so I've copied them here from the
Target-exclusive deluxe edition of the album. I've made a few modifications:
line breaks for readability, and title-casing words as opposed to leaving them
as originally printed in all uppercase.
