It's an understandable mistake when listeners pigeonhole the music of Australian
electronic musician and DJ Nick Bertke, better known as "Pogo", into the mood of
nostalgia. His music sits perfectly in the intersection of reverb-heavy, dreamy
music production techniques and the English-speaking world's Disney-sponsored
childhood. One need look no further than Pogo's first video, "[Alice]", which
heavily samples the 1951 Disney movie _Alice in Wonderland_. "Alice" was a viral
hit when it was released in 2007, and has 20+ million views to date.

But spend enough time on Pogo's channel, and you may find, as I did, that
instead of a sense of nostalgia pushing you to watch more Pogo remixes of Disney
movies, Pogo's other work may broaden your own cinematic appetite. For me, this
occurred after I watched "[J'adore Juin]", a joint effort between Pogo (music)
and goldpikpikcarrots (video). I loved the reflective descending harp line and
introduction of bass line in the second half, and decided to watch _The
Apartment_ (1960), the source for most of the samples in "J'adore Juin", for
context.

I returned to the "J'adore Juin" over a year after I first watched it, having
finally seen _The Apartment_. I wasn't sure what I was going to get out of
"J'adore Juin"; I would have simply been happy with being able to recognize the
clips. To my surprise, I found a whole new insight into "J'adore Juin".
Ironically, with the context of _The Apartment_, "J'adore Juin" transcended its
source and became an independent work. It is a critical response to _The
Apartment_, one that eclipses its source material by capturing an emotional
narrative better than _The Apartment_, but one that also realizes an independent
standard of beauty.

To call "J'adore Juin" a critical response likely is not in line with the modern
conception of criticism. The American public's exposure to criticism today
usually fits neatly into a weekly column written by someone that a publication
pays to offer an informed opinion on recently released books, film, or music.
The distinction between the work and the critical response is clear cut:
criticism is not art; it is less than art, as the dismissals such as "everyone's
a critic" or "fuck the haters" encapsulate.

In his essay "[The Critic As Artist]", set as a dialogue between two friends,
Oscar Wilde collapses this distinction. Critics are artists, he contends:

> To the critic the work of art is simply a suggestion for a new work of his
> own, that need not necessarily bear any obvious resemblance to the thing it
> criticises. The one characteristic of a beautiful form is that one can put
> into it whatever one wishes, and see in it whatever one chooses to see; and
> the Beauty, that gives to creation its universal and aesthetic element, makes
> the critic a creator in his turn, and whispers of a thousand different things
> which were not present in the mind of him who carved the statue or painted the
> panel or graved the gem.

And from the other side, artists must be critics as well:

> Without the critical faculty, there is no artistic creation at all, worthy of
> the name. You spoke a little while ago of that fine spirit of choice and
> delicate instinct of selection by which the artist realises life for us, and
> gives to it a momentary perfection. Well, that spirit of choice, that subtle
> tact of omission, is really the critical faculty in one of its most
> characteristic moods, and no one who does not possess this critical faculty can
> create anything at all in art.

For Wilde, the distinction between criticism and art does not exist at all, "The
antithesis between them is entirely arbitrary." The goal of art requires both
instincts working together: "… emotion for the sake of emotion is the aim of art
…".

To understand why "J'adore Juin" improves _The Apartment_, then, we need to
understand their emotional arcs.

## "We weep, but we are not wounded"

It's a bit disingenuous to talk about a singular mood or tone of _The
Apartment_. "[T]he pendulum swings from farce to tragic irony" reads [one
contemporary review][Hollywood Reporter review]. It helps to break _The
Apartment_ into a three act structure focused on Baxter, its protagonist:

1. Baxter balances the demands of various executives who wish to use his
   apartment for their trysts.

2. Miss Kubelik is introduced as a legitimate love interest into Baxter's life.

3. Baxter takes a stand against Mr. Sheldrake and quits his job.

Similarly, "J'adore Juin" breaks neatly into four quarters, approximately equal
in length, based both on the music and video editing:

1. Intro loops lasting until the clear vocal samples start around 0:58 with
   "What a time". In this context, clear means without heavy effects applied. In
   this intro section, there are vocal samples but the effects applied on them
   make the words nearly indistinguishable.

2. Clear vocal samples overlaid on intro loops ending when the piano loop starts
   around 1:40.

3. Piano loop including vocal samples until the vocal samples end around 2:35
   (this is not so cleanly defined: the vocal samples start about 20 seconds
   into this segment).

4. Just the background with no vocal samples until the end.

This structure is somewhat arbitrary, but functions well as a device to help
distill the moods of the various segments. In particular:

In _The Apartment_:

1. Farce. Baxter juggles the competing demands of various executives with his
   own sanity and well-being, often sacrificing himself to their demands in
   anticipation of his expedited promotion.

2. Tragic irony. Baxter and Miss Kubelik seem like they would be a good couple,
   but due to their circumstances they are incompatible.

3. Relief. Baxter frees himself from the exploitation of his company's
   executives by leaving his job, and Miss Kubelik leaves Mr. Sheldrake at a New
   Year's party to join Baxter.

In "J'adore Juin":

1. Bustle. The sampled percussion of Baxter cleaning up his kitchen and shots of
   his workplace give the impression of Baxter's sterile life dictated by his
   job. The dancing shots included in this section imply that while life is
   mostly business, he enjoys it.

2. Professionalism. While this section features shots of Baxter with Miss
   Kubelik, the continued background from (1) indicates that she has no special
   place in his life at this point. She is just another colleague with whom
   Baxter exchanges pleasantries as part of his daily routine.

3. Reflectivity, realization, loneliness: This is where the huge switch comes.
   The combination of the piano and the harp's A–C–G–A (tonic: F) line creates
   an atmosphere of melancholy[^send-in-the-clowns].

   [![A commenter expresses an emotional reaction to the harp
   line.](/media/jadore_juin/harp.png)][harp comment]

   The editing adds a loneliness element: Baxter sits at the bar alone, Baxter
   works alone, Baxter walks out of his apartment at night in the cold, Baxter
   shivers alone on a park bench. When the "What a time" sample loop starts
   again, it seems to ask a question: is career ambition worth it?

4. Fulfillment, satisfaction: The beginning of this segment continues the shots
   of a dejected looking Baxter, and appears to continue more of the somber
   loneliness that characterized (3). But a new shot appears: Miss Kubelik
   smiles at Baxter as she hands him a deck of playing cards at 2:45. The mood
   has changed. Miss Kubelik and Baxter smile as shots of their interactions
   from _The Apartment_ montage. Miss Olsen, Sheldrake's secretary, smiles,
   Baxter runs out of the office, and Miss Kubelik runs in the cold, smiling.

While the emotions evoked in each work are slightly different, the higher level
emotion arc in each roughly corresponds to a three act story. Each begins with
business as usual for Baxter. _The Apartment_ presents it in a farcical way,
while "J'adore Juin" gives us a more conventional presentation in (1) and (2):
the kitchen sampled percussion combined with quick cuts of his workplace. Miss
Kubelik's introduction as a romantic interest for Baxter forces him to realize
that perhaps his life is not so great, accomplished through dramatic irony in
_The Apartment_, and through the use of lonely shots of Baxter and the
piano/harp loop in "J'adore Juin". Both Baxter and Miss Kubelik manage to push
their lives forward in their respective final sections. _The Apartment_
indicates that while their relationship may not work out, they've at least freed
themselves, and "J'adore Juin" reminds us of the relationship-building moments
they've shared.

## "For life is terribly deficient in form"

But all this is a bit idealized, especially in the case of _The Apartment_.
While I can attempt to condense _The Apartment_ down to some emotional
narrative, there are obviously parts left out when considering a two hour film
in a few sentences per act. In doing so, I've perhaps presented _The Apartment_
in too warm a light.

I was disappointed when I saw _The Apartment_; I certainly didn't like it as
much as others ([Scaruffi], [Ebert], etc) did. My analysis above smoothes over
some corners I found a little sharp. I never get the sense that Miss Kubelik has
real motivations; her character only seems to exist in terms of her
relationships to Sheldrake and Baxter. She claims she loves Sheldrake, but only
ever acts cynically toward his continued insistence that he'll leave his wife.
In their first romantic meeting, they allude to a fling that we never see and
emotions we don't understand. Baxter, on the other hand, despite his affability
and nice guy exterior, comes off creepy at points. He tells Miss Kubelik that he
learned where she lives by reading her insurance file, but this blatant
violation of her privacy seems to have no repercussions on her opinion of him.
His continuous pursuit of her despite relatively little reciprocated interest
also seems to push into the gray area of sexual harassment. The film drags when
she's stuck in his apartment; there's very little relationship development. Miss
Kubelik laments not being able to find a good man like Baxter, and Baxter
responds by offering comforting platitudes and trying to steer the conversation
away from this sensitive topic. Other than that, we learn surface-level details
about Miss Kubelik, like her inability to spell, and about Baxter, who
accidentally shot himself in the leg, without any deepening of their patterns of
interaction. While both Baxter and Miss Kubelik's situations are so undesirable
that we're happy for them by the end when they can be together, the sense of
accomplishment is diluted by a lack of non-superficial shared experience on
which to base it.

## "To the [poet] belongs life in its full and absolute entirety …"

In other words, _The Apartment_'s emotional narrative does not quite connect.
The plot's inconsistencies leave me confused as a viewer; a nagging sensation
that parts of it don't make emotional sense cut into effect of the narrative.

But Oscar Wilde tells us that "To the critic the work of art is simply a
suggestion for a new work of his own, that need not necessarily bear any obvious
resemblance to the thing it criticises". "J'adore Juin" obviously does resemble
its critical object. It is because of this resemblance in both shot and
emotional narrative that make it easier to say that "J'adore Juin" is better
than _The Apartment_. Pogo and goldpikpikcarrots take _The Apartment_ and
extract its most core element: the relationship between Baxter and Miss Kubelik,
and transform it into a new work that is not weighed down by the inconsistencies
of the old. The musical cues and the editing of the video take the important
emotional beats from _The Apartment_ and distill or recycle them. The shot of
Baxter shivering in the park comes at the beginning of _The Apartment_, the
farcical section, but in "J'adore Juin", it fits the mood of the loneliness
section perfectly.

Not everything makes the cut: "J'adore Juin" does not dabble in farce the way
_The Apartment_ does. While "J'adore Juin" does capture the bustle of Baxter's
chain of calls to the executives in its beginning, it does so without any
undertones of comedy. Similarly, "J'adore Juin" devotes little time trying to
evoke a sense of pity for Baxter beyond that captured by his displayed
loneliness. In _The Apartment_, Baxter contracts the disdain of the other
tenants who see him as an insatiable womanizer, mistaking his employer's
executives' sexual exploits for his own, and from Miss Kubelik's brother in law,
who believes Baxter is taking advantage of Miss Kubelik after Baxter's
executives do not cover for him. Because Baxter's victimhood is not captured by
"J'adore Juin", it also cannot capture the sense of pride the audience feels for
Baxter when he finally stands up to Sheldrake.

_The Apartment_'s concrete plot allows the development of concepts like dramatic
irony, which are difficult to capture in anything but an abstract way in music.
Lacking a plot, though, is not necessarily a disadvantage. Music, eschewing
plot, avoids the trap of trying to hew too closely to reality. Wilde warns:

> The sculptor gladly surrenders imitative colour, and the painter the actual
> dimensions of form, because by such renunciations they are able to avoid too
> definite a presentation of the Real, which would be mere imitation …

Instead, to have an impact, music must pursue holistic emotional impression:

> It is through its very incompleteness that art becomes complete in beauty, and
> so addresses itself, not to the faculty of recognition nor to the faculty of
> reason, but to the aesthetic sense alone, which, while accepting both reason
> and recognition as stages of apprehension, subordinates them both to a pure
> synthetic impression of the work of art as a whole, and, taking whatever alien
> emotional elements the work may possess, uses their very complexity as a means
> by which a richer unity may be added to the ultimate impression itself.

"J'adore Juin" is not solely a musical composition; the video plays an essential
role in defining the emotional arc, but the video is fit to the music, so the
advantages of music apply. That is, "J'adore Juin" innately avoids being too
concrete. "This is the reason why music is the perfect type of art," puts Wilde.

## "Art does not address herself to the specialist"

Wilde also warns against the inverse of imitation, the danger of "realisation of
the Ideal". He claims that it is "too purely intellectual": "For, when the ideal
is realised, it is robbed of its wonder and its mystery, and becomes simply a
new starting-point for an ideal that is other than itself." I would put it a
different way: realization of the ideal means instead of imitating reality, art
is imitating some emotion, which may become obvious and indulgent. In a
different section, Wilde seems to agree:

> You see, then, how it is that the aesthetic critic rejects these obvious modes
> of art that have but one message to deliver, and having delivered it become
> dumb and sterile, and seeks rather for such modes as suggest reverie and mood,
> and by their imaginative beauty make all interpretations true, and no
> interpretation final.

In saying this, though, Wilde seems to have defused my point. If I've done my
job, then I've demonstrated the similarities in the emotional arcs from "J'adore
Juin" and _The Apartment_ and explained why "J'adore Juin" conveys these
emotions better than _The Apartment_. But if Wilde is right, then these
interpretations must be incomplete, and in fact, coming close to the ideal
emotional arc may be a disadvantage.

Wilde is right; my interpretation is incomplete. I do not attempt to capture all
of "J'adore Juin" or _The Apartment_ in it. There are parts, like [the sampling
of Frankie Avalon's "Venus" in the first half of "J'adore Juin"]["J'adore Juin"
"Venus"], or Miss Kubelik's suicide attempt in _The Apartment_ that gets her
stuck with Baxter for two days, that I do not attempt to address. Perhaps the
best way to understand the incompleteness of my interpretation, though, is to
know that I enjoyed "J'adore Juin" before I watched _The Apartment_, without any
of the context the film provides. While I like to think that I have a more
cohesive understanding of _The Apartment_ by understanding its interaction with
"J'adore Juin", other critics have their own views of _The Apartment_ that are
consistent within it as well. As Wilde says, "The one characteristic of a
beautiful form is that one can put into it whatever one wishes …". It is only
fair, then, to say that both "J'adore Juin" and _The Apartment_ are beautiful.
One just a little more so.

## Appendix: Other "J'adore Juin"s

While I consider the goldpipikcarrots edit of "J'adore Juin" canonical due to
the fact that it appears on Pogo's channel, there are other video edits of
"J'adore Juin".

* Frisco FX's [edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qltS5UcsVw8) uses the
  original 2010 audio (pre-remaster) and shows more of the dialogue clips in the
  context of _The Apartment_.
* goldpikpikcarrots put an [edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQOgSG2jJ5U)
  of "J'adore Juin" on his channel before it appeared on Pogo's official
  channel. This first edit doesn't completely match the canonical version, but
  is very close. It also uses the 2010 audio.
* [This adorable fan recreation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l---u0bKKE)
  (unavailable as of 2019-06) imitates goldpikpikcarrots's edit.

## Footnotes

[^send-in-the-clowns]:
    The harp line, according to Pogo, is sampled from the surround tracks from
    _The Simpsons_ episode ["Krusty Gets Kancelled"], in which [Krusty sings
    "Send in the Clowns"], a parody of the Stephen Sondheim song of the same
    name written for the character Desirée in _A Little Night Music_. Judi
    Dench, who played Desirée in a 1995 revival of _A Little Night Music_ in
    London, [describes it][Judi Dench _A Little Night Music_] as "quite a dark
    play. It's a play where a lot of people are with the wrong partners in the
    beginning and in the end, hopefully it's going to come right …"
