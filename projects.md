## Programming

* [little-tsp][github_little-tsp]: My implementation of a branch and bound
  described by Little et al in 1963 for the Traveling Salesperson Problem,
  ~10,000x faster than naive solution
* [wallpaper-grabber][github_wallpaper-grabber]: A framework for fetching images
  from a variety of sources to be used for wallpapers. I have written two
  fetchers that retrieve the National Geographic and Bing images of the day.
* [Model of Deformation of a Golf Ball][github_physics160]: My final project for
  Physics Honors Introduction to Mechanics simulates the deformation of
  ball-and-spring model of a golf ball when hit with a club. It is implemented
  with VPython (Visual + Python).
