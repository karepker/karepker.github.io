## Foreword

su3su2u1's tumblr site was deleted on 2016-02-26. A few intrepid readers
salvaged some of his posts, documented in [a post on the current placeholder
site][su3su2u1_archive_post].

Because I found su3su2u1's _Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_ series
of posts so well-put, I've taken the time to copy and reformat the salvaged
posts relating to _Methods_ on this page in chronological order, and cleaned up
the formatting a little bit. While su3su2u1 didn't specify an license for
copying the posts, he did write:

It's not clear how to attribute su3su2u1 anymore now that his tumblr is gone,
but I hope this is acceptable.

### HPMOR Chapter 1 {#ch1}

While at lunch, I dug into the first chapter of HPMOR.  A few notes:

This isn't nearly as bad as I remember, the writing isn't amazing but its
serviceable..  Either some editing has taken place in the last few years, or I'm
less discerning than I once was.

There is this strange bit, where Harry tries to diffuse an argument his parents
are having with:

""Mum," Harry said. "If you want to win this argument with Dad, look in chapter
two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics. There's a quote there
about how philosophers say a great deal about what science absolutely requires,
and it is all wrong, because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter
is observation - that you just have to look at the world and report what you
see. "

This seems especially out of place, because no one is arguing about what science
is. Otherwise, this is basically an ok little chapter.  Harry and Father are
skeptical magic could exist, so send a reply letter to Hogwarts asking for a
professor to come and show them some magics.

### Chapter 2, in which I remember why I hated this {#ch2}

This chapter had me rolling my eyes so hard that I now I have quite the
headache.  In this chapter, Professor McGonagall shows up and does some magic,
first levitating Harry's father, and then turning into a cat.  Upon seeing the
first, Harry drops some Bayes, saying how anticlimatic it was 'to update on an
event of infinitesimal probability,' upon seeing the second, Hariezer Yudotter
greets us with this jargon dump: "You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You
violated Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's implied
by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then
you get FTL signalling!"

First, this is obviously atrocious writing.  Most readers will get nothing out
of this horrific sentence.  He even abbreviated faster-than-light as FTL, to
keep the density of understandable words to a minimum.

Second, this is horrible physics for the following reasons:

-the levitation already violated conservation of energy,which you found
anticlimactic fuck you Hariezer

-the deep area of physics concerned with conservation of energy is not quantum
mechanics, its thermodynamics.  Hariezer should have had a jargon dump about
perpetual motion machines.  To see how levitation violates conservation of
energy, imagine taking a generator like the Hoover dam and casting a spell to
levitate all the water from the bottom of the dam back up to the top to close
the loop.  As long as you have wizard to move the water, you can generate power
forever.

Exercise for the reader- devise a perpetual motion machine powered by shape
changers (hint:imagine an elevator system of two carts hanging over a pully.  On
one side, an elephant, on the other a man. Elephant goes down, man goes up.  At
the bottom, the elephant turns into a man and at the top the man turns into an
elephant.  What happens to the pulley over time?)

-the deeper area related to conservation of energy is not unitarity, as is
implied in the quote.  There is a really deep theorem in physics, due to Emmy
Noether, that tells us that conservation of energy really means that physics is
time translationaly invariant. This means there aren't special places in time,
the laws tomorrow are basically the same as yesterday and today.  (tangential
aside- this is why we shouldn't worry about a lack of energy conservation at the
big bang, if the beginning of time was a special point, no one would expect
energy to be conserved there).

Unitarity in quantum mechanics is basically a fancy way of saying probability is
conserved. You CAN have unitarity without conservation of energy.  Technical
aside- its easy to show that if the unitary operator is time-translation
invariant, there is an operator that commutes with the unitary operator, usually
called the hamiltonian.  Without that assumption, we lose the hamiltonian but
maintain unitarity.

-None of this has much to do at all with faster than light signalling, which
would be the least of our concern if we had just discovered a source of infinite
energy.

I used to teach undergraduates, and I would often have some enterprising college
freshman (who coincidentally was not doing well in basic mechanics) approach me
to talk about why string theory was wrong.  It always felt like talking to a
physics madlibs book.  This chapter let me relive those awkward moments.

Sorry to belabor this point so much, but I think it sums up an issue that crops
up from time to time in Yudkowsky's writing, when dabbling in a subject he
doesn't have much grounding in, he ends up giving actual subject matter experts
a headache.

Summary of the chapter- McGonagall  visits and does some magic, Harry is
convinced magic is real, and they are off to go shop for Harry's books.

### Never Read Comments

I read the comments on an HPMOR chapter, which I recommend strongly against.  I
wish I could talk to several of the commentators, and gently talk them out of a
poor financial decision.

Poor, misguided random internet person- your donation to MIRI/LessWrong will not
help save the world.  Even if you grant all their (rather silly) assumptions
MIRI is a horribly unproductive research institute- in more than a decade, it
has published fewer peer reviewed papers than the average physics graduate
student does while in grad school.  The majority of money you donate to MIRI
will go into the generation of blog posts and fan fiction.  If you are fine with
that, then go ahead and spend your money, but don't buy into the idea that this
money will save the world.

### Chapter 2, in which I remember why I hated this

[nostalgebraist][nostalgebraist_chapter_2_yeah_all_this]:

So I kind of think the whole "Harry is an immature kid" thing allows EY to have
it both ways.  Anytime something comes off as twerpish, it can be waved away as
Hariezer's immaturity, but we aren't supposed to doubt the received wisdom from
Hariezer sprinkled throughout the chapters, even though it comes from the same
immature source.  Readers impressed with the Feynman reference and the jargon
dumps can pat Yud on the back, and readers who realize it widely misses the mark
can chalk it up to youthful arrogance and say how well-realized the character is
(and pat Yud on the back).

It reminds me of Special Topics in Calamity Physics, which is a book loaded with
imprecise metaphors and allusions (that often contradict the actual scene being
described).  It feels like the author wants us to say 'what a clever bit of
writing' when it works, and to say 'what a pretentious narrating character' when
it fails.

### HPMOR Chapter 3, uneventful, inoffensive {#ch3}

This chapter is worse than the previous chapters.  As Hariezer (I realize this
portmanteau isn't nearly as clever as I seem to think it is, but I will continue
to use it) enters diagon alley, he remarks

"It was like walking through the magical items section of an _Advanced Dungeons
and Dragons_ rulebook (he didn't play the game, but he did enjoy reading the
rulebooks). " For reasons not entirely clear to me, the line filled me with
rage.

As they walk McGonagall tells Hariezer about Voldemort, noting that other
countries failed to come to Britain's aid.  This prompts Hariezer to immediately
misuse the idea of the Bystander Effect (an exercise left to the reader- do
social psychological phenomena that apply to individuals also apply to
collective entities, like countries? Are the social-psychological phenomena
around failure to act in people likely to also explain failure to act as
organizations?)

Thats basically it for this chapter.  Uneventful chapter- slightly misused
scientific stuff, a short walk through diagon alley, standard Voldemort stuff.
The chapter ends with some very heavy handed foreshadowing:

"(And somewhere in the back of his mind was a small, small note of confusion, a
sense of something wrong about that story; and it should have been a part of
Harry's art to notice that tiny note, but he was distracted. For it is a sad
rule that whenever you are most in need of your art as a rationalist, that is
when you are most likely to forget it.)"

If Harry had only attended more CFAR workshops...

### nostalgebraist: (Also I added ...

[nostalgebraist][nostalgebraist_chapter_2_thats_pretty_much]:

  > (Also I added something to that post since you reblogged it — I'm confused
  > about why Harry things conservation of energy is being violated when there
  > are forms of energy that aren't necessary perceptible?)

Given the style of story, I have no doubt that both the levitation and the cat
thing will eventually fit into some sort of laws-of-magic.  In that case, we
could append the laws of magic to the laws of physics, and instead of energy
conservation being violated, we'll have some new forms of magical energy. Its
actually part of the story I'll probably enjoy, when/if I make it there.

### Anon Asks

Anon points out that I'm "unfairly" beating up on Yudkowsky, who is an
autodidact without the the benefits of a formal education.

So a few points:

-I don't think I'm beating up on Yudkowsky at all.  I am instead discussing a
story he wrote with a critical eye.  In particular, HPMOR is explicitly supposed
to be pedagogical, its supposed to teach the reader things. Therefore, we should
keep on eye on what it is teaching.

-I will probably occasionally also criticize the sequences for similar reasons.
Nothing is more frustrating than getting a student in an introductory quantum
mechanics class who thinks they've learned it all in the LessWrong sequences
(this has happened to me twice).  I fear one of the (erroneous) lessons the
sequences implicitly teach is that you can know as much (or MORE) as physicists
about the proper way to do quantum mechanics simply by reading a few dozen
pages.

The key here is that this is about ideas, and writing, not about the man
himself.  Its important to keep those things separate.

### Chapter 4 - In which, for the first time, I wanted the author to take things further {#ch4}

So first, I actually like this chapter more than the previous few, because I
think its beginning to try to deliver on what I want in the story.  And now, my
bitching will commence:

A recurring theme of the LessWrong sequences that I find somewhat frustrating is
that (apart from the Bayesian Rationalist) the world is insane.  This same theme
pops up in this MOR chapter, where the world is created insane by Yudkowsky, so
that Hariezer can tell you why.

Upon noticing the wizarding world uses coins of silver and gold, Hariezer asks
about exchange rates, and asks the bank goblin how much it would cost to get a
big chunk of silver turned into coins, the goblin says he'll check with his
superiors, Hariezer asks him to estimate, and the estimate is that the fee is
about 5% of the silver.

This prompts Hariezer to realize that he could do the following:

1. Take gold coins and buy silver with them in the muggle world
2. bring the silver to Gringots and have it turned into coins
3. convert the silver coins to gold coins, ending up with more gold than you
   started with, start the loop over until the muggle prices make it not
   profitable

(of course, the in-story explanation is overly-jargon filled as usual)

This is somewhat interesting, and its the first look at what I want in a story
like this- the little details of the wizarding world that would never be covered
in a children's story.  Stross wrote a whole book exploring money/economics in a
far future society (Neptune's Brood, its only ok), there is a lot of fertile
ground for Yudkowsky here.

In a world where wizards can magic wood into gold, how do you keep
counterfeiting at bay? Maybe the coins are made of special gold only goblins
know how to find (maybe the goblin hordes hoard (wordplay!) this special gold
like De beers hoards diamonds).

Maybe the goblins carefully magic money into and out of existence in order to
maintain a currency peg.  Maybe its the perfect inflation- instead of relying on
banks to disperse the coins every and now and then the coins in people's pockets
just multiply at random.

Instead, we get a silly, insane system (don't blame Rowling either- Yudkowsky is
more than willing to go off book, AND the details of this simply aren't
discussed, for good reason, in the genre Rowling wrote the books in), and
rationalist Hariezer gets an easy 'win'.  Its not a BAD section, but it feels
lazy.

And a brief note on the writing style- its still oddly stilted, and I wonder how
good it would be at explaining ideas to someone unfamiliar.  For instance,
Hariezer gets lost in thought McGonagall says something, Hariezer replies:

  > "Hm?" Harry said, his mind elsewhere. "Hold on, I'm doing a Fermi
  > calculation."
  >
  > "A what? " said Professor McGonagall, sounding somewhat alarmed.
  >
  > "It's a mathematical thing. Named after Enrico Fermi. A way of getting rough
  > numbers quickly in your head..."

Maybe it would feel less awkward for Hariezer to say "Hold on, I'm trying to
estimate how much gold is in the vault." And then instead of saying "its a math
thing," we could follow Hariezer's thoughts as he carefully constructs his
estimate (as it is, the estimate is crammed into a hard-to-read paragraph).

Its a nitpick, sure, but the story thus far is loaded with such nits.

Chapter summary- Harry goes to gringots, takes out money.

### Chapter 5 - In which the author assures us repeatedly this chapter is funny {#ch5}

This chapter is, again, mostly inoffensive, although there is a weird tonal
shift.  The bulk of this chapter is played broadly for laughs.  There is
actually a decent description of the fundamental attribution error, although its
introduced with this twerpy bit of dialogue

  > Harry looked up at the witch-lady's strict expression beneath her pointed
  > hat, and sighed. "I suppose there's no chance that if I said _fundamental
  > attribution error_ you'd have any idea what that meant."

This sort of thing seems like awkward pedagogy.  If the reader doesn't know it,
Hariezer is now exasperated with the reader as well as with whoever Yudkowsky is
currently using as a foil.

Now, the bulk of this chapter involves Hariezer being left alone to buy robes,
where he meets and talks to Draco Malfoy.  Hariezer, annoyed at having people
say to him "OMG, YOU ARE HARRY POTTER!" upon meeting and learning Malfoy's name,
exclaims "OMG, YOU ARE DRACO MALFOY!".  Malfoy accepts this as a perfectly
normal reaction to his imagined fame, and a mildly amusing conversation occurs.
Its a fairly clever idea.

Unfortunately, its marred by the literary equivalent of a sitcom laugh track.
Worried that the reader isn't sure if they should be laughing, Yudkowsky
interjects phrases like these throughout:

  > Draco's attendant emitted a sound like she was strangling but kept on with
  > her work
  >
  > One of the assistants, the one who'd seemed to recognise Harry, made a
  > muffled choking sound.
  >
  > One of Malkin's assistants had to turn away and face the wall.
  >
  > Madam Malkin looked back silently for four seconds, and then cracked up. She
  > fell against the wall, wheezing out laughter, and that set off both of her
  > assistants, one of whom fell to her hands and knees on the floor, giggling
  > hysterically.

The reader is constantly told that the workers in the shop find it so funny they
can barely contain their laughter.  It feels like the author constantly yelling
GET IT YOU GUYS? THIS IS FUNNY!

As far as the writing goes, the tonal shift to broad comedy feels a bit strange
and happens with minimal warning (there is a brief conversation earlier in the
chapter thats also played for a laugh), and everything is as stilted as its
always been.  For example, when McGonagall walks into the robe shop in time to
hear Malfoy utter some absurdities, Harry tells her

  > "He was in a situational context where those actions made internal sense -"

Luckily, Hariezer gets cut off before he starts explaining what a joke is.
Chapter summary- Hariezer buys robes, talks to Malfoy.

### Chapter 6- Yud lets it all hang out {#ch6}

The introduction suggested that the story really gets moving after chapter 5.
If this is an example of what "really moving" looks like, I fear I'll soon stop
reading.  Apart from my rant about chapter 2, things had been largely light, and
inoffensive up until this chapter.  Here, I found myself largely recoiling.  We
shift from the broad comedy of the last chapter to a chapter filled with weirdly
dark little rants.

As should be obvious by now, I find the line between Eliezer and Harry to be
pretty blurry (hence my annoying use of Hariezer).  In this chapter, that line
disappears completely as we get passages like this

  > Harry had always been frightened of ending up as one of those child
  > prodigies that never amounted to anything and spent the rest of their lives
  > boasting about how far ahead they'd been at age ten. But then most adult
  > geniuses never amounted to anything either. There were probably a thousand
  > people as intelligent as Einstein for every actual Einstein in history.
  > Because those other geniuses hadn't gotten their hands on the one thing you
  > absolutely needed to achieve greatness. They'd never found an important
  > problem.

There are dozens of such passages that could be ripped directly from some of
Hariezer's friendly AI writing and pasted right into MOR.  Its a bit
disconcerting, in part because its forcing me to face just how much of Eliezer's
other writing of wasted time with.

The chapter begins strongly enough, Hariezer starts doing some experiments with
his magic pouch.  If he asks for 115 gold coins, it comes, but not if he asks
for 90+25 gold coins. He tries using other words for gold in other languages,
etc.  Unfortunately, it leads him to say this:

  > "I just falsified every single hypothesis I had! How can it know that 'bag
  > of 115 Galleons' is okay but not 'bag of 90 plus 25 Galleons'? It can count
  > but it can't add? It can understand nouns, but not some noun phrases that
  > mean the same thing?...The rules seem sorta consistent but they don't mean
  > anything! I'm not even going to ask how a pouch ends up with voice
  > recognition and natural language understanding when the best Artificial
  > Intelligence programmers can't get the fastest supercomputers to do it after
  > thirty-five years of hard work,"

So here is the thing- it would be very easy to write a parser that behaves
exactly like what Hariezer describes with his bag.  You would just have a
look-up table with lots of single words for gold in various languages.  Nothing
fancy at all.  Its behaving oddly ENTIRELY BECAUSE ITS NOT DOING NATURAL
LANGUAGE.  I hope we revisit the pouch in a later chapter to sort this out.  I
reiterate, its stuff like this that (to me at least) were the whole premise of
this story- flesh out the rules of this wacky universe.

Immediately after this, the story takes a truly bizarre turn.  Hariezer spots a
magic first aid kit, and wants to buy it.  In order to be a foil for
super-rationalist Harry, McGonagall then immediately becomes immensely stupid,
and tries to dissuade him from purchasing it.  Note, she doesn't persuade him by
saying "Oh, there are magical first aid kits all over the school," or "there are
wizards watching over the boy who lived who can heal you with spells if
something happens" or anything sensible like that, she just starts saying he'd
never need it.

This leads Harry to a long description of the planning fallacy, and he says to
counter it he always tries to assume the worst possible outcomes. (Note to Harry
and the reader: the planning fallacy is a specific thing that occurs when people
or organizations plan to accomplish a task.  What Harry is trying to overcome is
more correctly optimism bias.).

This leads McGonagall to start lightly suggesting (apropos of nothing) that
maybe Harry is an abused child.  Hariezer responds with this tale:

  > "There'd been some muggings in our neighborhood, and my mother asked me to
  > return a pan she'd borrowed to a neighbor two streets away, and I said I
  > didn't want to because I might get mugged, and she said, 'Harry, don't say
  > things like that!' Like thinking about it would make it happen, so if I
  > didn't talk about it, I would be safe. I tried to explain why I wasn't
  > reassured, and she made me carry over the pan anyway. I was too young to
  > know how statistically unlikely it was for a mugger to target me, but I was
  > old enough to know that not-thinking about something doesn't stop it from
  > happening, so I was really scared."
  >
  > ...
  >
  > I know it doesn't sound like much," Harry defended. "But it was just one of
  > those critical life moments, you see? ... That's when I realised that everyone
  > who was supposed to protect me was actually crazy, and that they wouldn't
  > listen to me no matter how much I begged them

So we are back to the world is insane, as filtered through this odd little
story.

Then McGonagall asks if Harry wants to buy an owl, and Harry says no he'd be too
worried he'd forget to feed it or something.  Which prompts McGonagall AGAIN to
suggest Harry had been abused, which leads Harry into an odd rant about how
false accusations of child abuse ruin families (which is true, but seriously, is
this the genre for this rant?  What the fuck is happening with this chapter?)

This ends up with McGonagall implying Harry must have been abused because he is
so weird, and maybe some cast a spell to wipe his memory of it (the spell comes
up after Harry suggests repressed memories are BS pseudoscience, which again, is
true, BUT WHY IS THIS HAPPENING IN THIS STORY?)

Harry uses his 'rationalist art' (literally "Harry's rationalist skills begin to
boot up again")  to suggest an alternative explanation

  > "I'm too smart, Professor. I've got nothing to say to normal children.
  > Adults don't respect me enough to really talk to me. And frankly, even if
  > they did, they wouldn't sound as smart as Richard Feynman, so I might as
  > well read something Richard Feynman wrote instead. I'm isolated, Professor
  > McGonagall. I've been isolated my whole life. Maybe that has some of the
  > same effects as being locked in a cellar. And I'm too intelligent to look up
  > to my parents the way that children are designed to do. My parents love me,
  > but they don't feel obliged to respond to reason, and sometimes I feel like
  > they're the children - children who won't listen and have absolute authority
  > over my whole existence. I try not to be too bitter about it, but I also try
  > to be honest with myself, so, yes, I'm bitter.

After that weird back and forth the chapter moves on, Harry goes and buys a
wand, and then from conversation begins to suspect that the Voldemort might
still be alive.  When McGonagall doesn't want to tell him more, "a terrible dark
clarity descended over his mind, mapping out possible tactics and assessing
their consequences with iron realism."

This leads Hariezer to blackmail McGonagall- he won't tell people Voldemort is
still alive if she tells him about the prophecy.  Its another weird bit in a
chapter absolutely brimming with weird bits.

Finally they go to buy a trunk, but they are low on gold (note to the reader:
here would have been an excellent example of the planning fallacy).  But luckily
Hariezer had taken extra from the vault.  Rather than simply saying "oh, I
brought some extra", he says

  > So - suppose I had a way to get more Galleons from my vaultwithout us going
  > back to Gringotts, but it involved me violating the role of an obedient
  > child. Would I be able to trust you with that, even though you'd have to
  > step outside your own role as Professor McGonagall to take advantage of it?

So he logic-chops her into submission, or whatever, and they buy the trunk.

This chapter for me was incredibly uncomfortable.  McGonagall behaves very
strangely so she can act as a foil for all of Hariezer's rants, and when the
line between Hariezer and Eliezer fell away completely, it felt a bit oddly
personal.

Oh, right, there was also a conversation about the rule against underage magic

  > "Ah," Harry said. "That sounds like a very sensible rule. I'm glad to see
  > the wizarding world takes that sort of thing seriously."

I can't help but draw parallels to the precautions Yud wants with AI.

Summary: Harry finished buying school supplies(I hope).

_[Ed. This is between where the wayback archive finished archiving, and before
the feedly archive begins, so there is a large gap here with a few (parts of)
posts salvaged.]_

### A few Observations Regarding Hariezer Yudotter

_[Ed. Full post salvaged from [cinnimonipod's
tumblr][cinnimonipod_this_this_is].]_

After drunkenly reading chapters 8,9 and 10 last night (I’ll get to the posts
soon, hopefully), I was flipping channels and somehow settled on an episode of
that old TV show with Steve Urkel (bear with me, this will get relevant in a
second).

In the episode, the cool kid Eddie gets hustled at billiards, and Urkel comes in
and saves the day because his knowledge of trigonometry and geometry makes him a
master at the table.

I think perhaps this is a common dream of the science fetishist- if only I knew
ALL OF THE SCIENCE I would be unstoppable at everything.  Hariezer Yudotter is a
sort of wish fulfillment character of that dream.  Hariezer isn't motivated by
curiosity at all really, he wants to grow his super-powers by learning more
science.  Its why we can go 10 fucking chapters without Yudotter really
exploring much in the way of the science of magic (so far I count one lazy
paragraph exploring what his pouch can do, in 10 chapters).  Its why he
constantly describes his project as “taking over the world.”  And its
frustrating, because this obviously isn't a flaw to be overcome its part of
Yudotter's "awesomeness."

I have a phd in a science, and it has granted me these real world super-powers-

1. I fix my own plumbing, do my own home repairs,etc.

2. I made a robot of legos and a raspberry pi that plays connect 4 incredibly
   well (my robot sidekick, I guess)

3. Via techniques I learned in the sorts of books that in fictional world
   Hariezer uses to be a master manipulator, I can optimize ads on webpages such
   that up to 3% of people will click on them (that is, seriously, the power of
   influence in reality. Not Hannibal Lector but instead advertisers trying to
   squeeze an extra tenth of a percent on conversions), for which companies
   sometime pay me

4. If you give me a lot of data, I can make a computer find patterns in it, for
   which companies sometimes pay me.

Thats basically it.  Back when I worked in science, I spent nearly a decade of
my life calculating various background processes related to finding a Higgs
boson, and I helped design some software theorists now use to calculate new
processes quickly.  These are the sorts of projects scientists work on, and most
days its hard work and total drudgery, and there is no obvious ‘instrumental
utility’- BUT I REALLY WANTED TO KNOW IF THERE WAS A HIGGS FIELD.

And thats why I think the Yudotter character doesn't feel like a scientist- he
wants to be stronger, more powerful, take over the world, but he doesn't seem to
care what the answers are.  Its all well and good to be driven, but most
importantly, you have to be curious.

### Chapter 8 - Back to the Inoffensive Chapters of Yesteryear {#ch8}

_[Ed. Full (?) post salvaged from [kai-skia's
tumblr][kai-skai_i_as_usual].]_

[...]

And Yudkowsky knows enough that his tone is off-putting to point to it.  So I
wonder- is this story ACTUALLY teaching people things?  Or is it just a way for
people who already know some of the material to feel superior to Hariezer's many
foils? Do people go and read the sequences so that they can move from
Hariezer-foil, to Hariezer's point of view?  (these are not rhetorical
questions, if anyone has ideas on this).

[...]

As for the rest of the chapter- its good to see Hermione merits as human, unlike
Ron.  There is a strange bit in the chapter where Neville asks a Gryffindor
prefect to find his frog, and the prefect says no (why? what narrative purpose
does this serve?).

[...]

### Chapters 9 and 10 {#ch9-10}

_[Ed. Full (?) post salvaged from [thinkingornot's
tumblr][thinkingornot_actually_the_hat].]_

Alright, the lagavulin is flowing, and I'm once more equipped to pontificate.

These chapters are really one chapter split in two.  I'm going to use them to
argue against Yudkowsky's friendly AI concept a bit.  There is this idea, called
‘orthgonality' that says that an AIs goals can be completely independent of its
intelligence.  So you can say ‘increase happiness' and this uber-optimizer can
tile the entire universe with tiny molecular happy faces, because its brilliant
at optimizing but incapable of evaluating its goals.  Just setting the stage for
the next chapter.

In this chapter, Harry gets sorted.  When the sorting hat hits his head, Harry
wonders if its self-aware, which because of some not-really-explained magical
hat property, instantly makes the hat self-aware.  The hat finds being self
aware uncomfortable, and Hariezer worries that he'll destroy an intelligent
being when the hat is removed.  The hat assures us that the hat cares only for
sorting children. As Hariezer notes

  > It [the hat] was still imbued with only its own strange goals...

Even still, Hariezer manages to blackmail the hat- he threatens to tell all the
other kids to wonder if the hat is self-aware.  The hat concedes to the demand.

So how does becoming self-aware over and over effect the hat's goals of sorting
people? It doesn't.  The blackmail should fail.  Yudkowsky imagines that the
minute it became self-aware, the hat couldn't help but pick up some new goals.
Even Yudkowsky imagines that becoming self-aware will have some effects on your
goals.

This chapter also has some more weirdly personal seeming moments when the line
between Yudkowsky's other writing and HPMOR breaks down completely.

summary- Harry gets sorted into ravenclaw.

I am immensely frustrated that I'm 10 chapters into this thing, and we still
don't have any experiments regarding the rules of magic.

### Chapter 18 - What? {#ch18}

_[Ed. partially recovered via
[kai-skai's tumblr post][kai-skai_chapter_18_what_uh_i_have]]_

[...]

This leads to a meeting with the headmaster where Hariezer THREATENS TO START A
NEWSPAPER CAMPAIGN AGAINST SNAPE (find a newspaper interested in the 'some
students think professor too hard on them, for instance he asked Hariezer
Yudotter 3 hard questions in a row' story)

[...]

Nowhere in this chapter does Hariezer consider that he deprived other students
of the damn potions lesson.  In his ruminations about why Snape keeps his job,
he never considers that maybe Snape knows a lot about potions/is actually a good
potions teacher.

[...]

### Ideas Around Chapter 19 {#ch19}

In light of the recent anon, I'm going to attempt to give the people (person?)
what they want. Also, I went from not caring if people were reading this, to
being a tiny bit anxious I'll lose the audience I unexpectedly picked up.
SELLING OUT.

If we ignore the literal child abuse of the chapter, the core of the idea is
still somewhat malignant. Its true throughout that Hariezer DOES have a problem
with "knowing how to lose," but the way you learn to lose is by losing, not by
being ordered to take a beating.

Quirrell could have challenged Hariezer to a game of chess, he could have asked
questions Hariezer didn't know the answer to (as Snape did, which prompted the
insane chapter 18), etc. But the problem is the author is so invested in
Hariezer being the embodiment of awesome that even when he needs to lose for
story purposes, to learn a lesson, Yudkowsky doesn't want to let Hariezer
actually lose at something. Instead he gets ordered to lose, and he isn't
ordered to lose at something in his wheel house, but in the "jock-stuff"
repeatedly sneered at in the story (physical confrontation)

### Chapter 20- Why is this chapter called Bayes Theorem? {#ch20}

A return to what passes for "normal." No child beating in this chapter, just a
long, boring conversation.

This chapter opens with Hariezer ruminating about how much taking that beating
sure has changes his life. He knows how to lose now, he isn't going to become
dark lord now! Quirrell quickly takes him down a peg:

  > "Mr. Potter," he said solemnly, with only a slight grin, "a word of advice.
  > There is such a thing as a performance which is too perfect. Real people who
  > have just been beaten and humiliated for fifteen minutes do not stand up and
  > graciously forgive their enemies. It is the sort of thing you do when you're
  > trying to convince everyone you're not Dark, not -"

Hariezer protests, and we get

  > There is nothing you can do to convince me because I would know that was
  > exactly what you were trying to do. And if we are to be even more precise,
  > then while I suppose it is barely possible that perfectly good people exist
  > even though I have never met one, it is nonetheless improbable that someone
  > would be beaten for fifteen minutes and then stand up and feel a great surge
  > of kindly forgiveness for his attackers. On the other hand it is less
  > improbable that a young child would imagine this as the role to play in
  > order to convince his teacher and classmates that he is not the next Dark
  > Lord. The import of an act lies not in what that act resembles on the
  > surface, Mr. Potter, but in the states of mind which make that act more or
  > less probable

How does Hariezer take this? Does he point out "if no evidence can sway your
priors, your priors are too strong?" or some other bit of logic-chop Bayes-judo?
Nope, he drops some nonsensical jargon:

  > Harry blinked. He'd just had the dichotomy between the representativeness
  > heuristic and the Bayesian definition of evidence explained to him by a
  > wizard.

Where is Quirrell using bayesian evidence? He isn't, he is neglecting all
evidence because all evidence fits his hypothesis. Where does the
representativeness heuristic come into play? It doesn't.

The representative heuristic is making estimates based on how typical of a class
something is. i.e. show someone a picture of a stereotypical 'nerd' and say "is
this person more likely an english or a physics grad student?" The
representative heuristic says "you should answer physics." Its a good
rule-of-thumb that psychologists think is probably hardwired into us. It also
leads to some well-known fallacies I won't get into here.

Quirrell is of course doing none of that- Quirrell has a hypothesis that fits
anything Hariezer could do, so no amount of evidence will dissuade him.

After this, Quirrell and Hariezer have a long talk about science (because of
course Quirrell too has a fascination with space travel).  This leads to some
real Less Wrong stuff.

Quirrell tells us that of course muggle scientists are dangerous because

  > There are gates you do not open, there are seals you do not breach! The
  > fools who can't resist meddling are killed by the lesser perils early on,
  > and the survivors all know that there are secrets you do not share with
  > anyone who lacks the intelligence and the discipline to discover them for
  > themselves!

And of course, Hariezer agrees

  > This was a rather different way of looking at things than Harry had grown up
  > with. It had never occurred to him that nuclear physicists should have
  > formed a conspiracy of silence to keep the secret of nuclear weapons from
  > anyone not smart enough to be a nuclear physicist

Which is a sort of weirdly elitist position- after all lots of nuclear
physicists are plenty dangerous.  Its not intelligence that makes you less
likely to drop a bomb.  But this fits the general Yudkowsky/AI fear- an open
research community is less important than hiding dangerous secrets.  This isn't
necessarily the wrong position, but its a challenging one that merits actual
discussion.

Anyone who has done research can tell you how important the open flow of ideas
is for progress.  I'm of the opinion that the increasing privatization of
science is actually slowing us down in a lot of ways by building silos around
information.  How much do we retard progress in order to keep dangerous ideas
out of people's hands?  Who gets to decide what is dangerous? Who decides who
gets let into "the conspiracy?"  Intelligence alone is no guarantee someone
won't drop a bomb, despite how obvious it seems to Quirrell and Yudotter.

After this digression about nuclear weapons, we learn from Quirrell that he
snuck into NASA and enchanted the Pioneer gold plaque that will "make it last a
lot longer than it otherwise would."  Its unclear to me what that wear and tear
Quirrell is protecting the plaque from.  Hariezer suggest that Quirrell might
have snuck a magic portrait or a ghost into the plaque, because nothing makes
more sense then dooming an (at least semi) sentient being to a near eternity of
solitary confinement.

Anyway, partway through this chapter, Dumbledore bursts in angry that Quirrell
had Hariezer beaten.  Hariezer defends him, etc.  The resolution is that its
agreed Hariezer will start learning to protect himself from mind readers.

Chapter summary- long, mostly boring conversation, peppered with some
existential risk/we need to escape the planet rhetoric. Its also called Bayes
theorem despite that theorem making no appearance whatsoever.

And a note on the really weird pedagogy- we now have Quirrell who in the books
is possessed by Voldemort acting as a mouthpiece for the author.  This seems
like a bad choice, because at some point I assume we'll there will be a reveal,
and it will turn out the reader should have trusted Quirrell.

Its unclear to me why turning the pioneer plaque into a horcrux is a good idea.
How do the horcrux's work? Did Voldemort doom a copy of himself to eternal
solitary confinement?

I sort of thought the whole point of a horcrux was that if you died, there is a
copy of you out there that can posses some poor sod like Quirrell if he got to
close.  What good is a horcrux that can never find another human?

### Chapter 21- Secretive Science {#ch21}

So this chapter begins quite strangely- Hermione is worried that she is "bad"
because she is enjoying being smarter than Hariezer.  She then decides that she
isn't "bad", its a budding romance.  Thats the logic she uses.  But because she
won the book-reading contest against Hariezer (he doesn't flip out, it must be
because he learned "how to lose"), she gets to go on a date with him.  The date
is skipped over.

Next we find Hariezer meeting Malfoy in a dark basement, discussing how they
will go about doing science.  Malfoy is written as uncharacteristically stupid,
in order to be a foil once more for Hariezer, peppering the conversation with
such gems as:

  > Then I'll figure out how to make the experimental test say the right answer!

  > "You can always make the answer come out your way," said Draco. That had
  > been practically the first thing his tutors had taught him. "It's just a
  > matter of finding the right arguments."

We get a lot of platitudes from Hariezer about how science humbles you before
nature.  But then we get the same ideas Quirrell suggested previously, because
"science is dangerous", they are going to run their research program as a
conspiracy.

  > "As you say, we will establish our own Science, a magical Science, and that
  > Science will have smarter traditions from the very start." The voice grew
  > hard. "The knowledge I share with you will be taught alongside the
  > disciplines of accepting truth, the level of this knowledge will be keyed to
  > your progress in those disciplines, and you will share that knowledge with
  > no one else who has not learned those disciplines. Do you accept this?"

And the name of this secretive scienspiracy?

  > And standing amid the dusty desks in an unused classroom in the dungeons of
  > Hogwarts, the green-lit silhouette of Harry Potter spread his arms
  > dramatically and said, "This day shall mark the dawn of... the Bayesian
  > Conspiracy."

Of course.  I mentioned in the previous chapter, anyone who has done science
knows that its a collaborative process that requires an open exchange of ideas.

And see what I mean about the melding of ideas between Quirrell and Hariezer?
Its weird to use them both as author mouthpieces.  The Bayesian Conspiracy is
obviously an idea Yudkowsky is fond of, and here Hariezer gets the idea largely
from Quirrell just one chapter back.

### Chapter 22- Science! {#ch22}

This chapter opens strongly enough.  Hariezer decides that the entire wizarding
world has probably been wrong about magic, and don't know the first thing about
it.

Hermione disagrees, and while she doesn't outright say "maybe you should read a
magical theory book about how spells are created" (such a thing must exist), she
is at least somewhat down that path.

To test his ideas, Hariezer creates a single-blind test- he gets spells from a
book, changes the words or the wrist motion or what not and gets Hermione to
cast them.  Surprisingly, Hariezer is proven wrong by this little test.  For
once, the world isn't written as insane as a foil for our intrepid hero.

It seemed the universe actually did want you to say 'Wingardium Leviosa' and it
wanted you to say it in a certain exact way and it didn't care what you thought
the pronunciation should be any more than it cared how you felt about gravity.

There are a few anti-academic snipes, because it wouldn't be HPMOR without a
little snide swipe at academia:

  > But if my books were worth a carp they would have given me the following
  > important piece of advice...Don't worry about designing an elaborate course
  > of experiments that would make a grant proposal look impressive to a funding
  > agency.

Weird little potshots about academia (comments like "so many bad teachers, its
like 8% as bad as Oxford," "Harry was doing better in classes now, at least the
classes he considered interesting")  have been peppered throughout the chapters
since Hariezer arrived at Hogwarts.  Oh academia, always trying to make you
learn things that might be useful, even if they are a trifle boring.  So full of
bad teachers, etc.  Just constant little comments attacking school and academia.

Anyway, this chapter would be one of the strongest chapters, except there is a
second half.  In the second half, Hariezer partners with Draco to get to the
bottom of wizarding blood purity.

Harry Potter had asked how Draco would go about disproving the blood purist
hypothesis that wizards couldn't do the neat stuff now that they'd done eight
centuries ago because they had interbred with Muggleborns and Squibs.

Here is the thing about science, step 0 needs to be make sure you're trying to
explain a real phenomena.  Hariezer knows this, he tells the story of N-rays
earlier in the chapter, but completely fails to understand the point.

Hariezer and Draco have decided, based on one anecdote (the founders of Hogwarts
were the best wizards ever, supposedly) that wizards are weaker today than in
the past.  The first thing they should do is find out if wizards are actually
getting weaker.  After all, the two most dangerous dark wizards ever were both
recent, Grindelwald and Voldemort.  Dumbledore is no slouch.  Even four students
were able to make the marauders map just one generation before Harry.
(Incidentally, this is exactly where neoreactionaries often go wrong- they
assume things are getting worse without actually checking, and then create
elaborate explanations for non-existent facts).

Anyway, for the purposes of the story, I'm sure it'll turn out that wizards are
getting weaker, because Yudkoswky wrote it.  But this would have been a great
chance to teach an actually useful lesson, and it would make the N-ray story
told earlier a useful example, and not a random factoid.

Anyway, to explain the effect they come up with a few obvious hypotheses:

  > 1. Magic itself is fading.  
  > 2. Wizards are interbreeding with Muggles and Squibs.  
  > 3. Knowledge to cast powerful spells is being lost.  
  > 4. Wizards are eating the wrong foods as children, or something else besides
  >    blood is making them grow up weaker.  
  > 5. Muggle technology is interfering with magic. (Since 800 years ago?)  
  > 6. Stronger wizards are having fewer children. (Draco = only child? Check if
  >    3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, had any children.)

They miss some other obvious ones (there is a finite amount of magic power, so
increasing populations = more wizards = less power per wizard, for instance.
Try to come up with your own, its easy and fun).

They come up with some ways to collect some evidence- find out what the first
year curriculum was throughout Hogwarts history, and do some wizard genealogy by
talking to portraits.

Still, finally some science, even if half of it was infuriating.

### Chapter 23- Wizarding genetics made (way too) simple {#ch23}

Alright, I need to preface this: I have the average particle physicists
knowledge of biology (a few college courses, long ago mostly forgotten).  That
said, the lagavulin is flowing, so I'm going to pontificate as if I'm obviously
right, so please reblog me with corrections if I am wrong.

In this chapter, Hariezer and Draco are going to explore what I think of as the
blood hypothesis- that wizardry is carried in the blood, and that intermarriage
with non-magical types is diluting wizardry.

Hariezer gives Draco a brief, serviceable enough description of DNA (more like
pebbles than water),   He lays out two models- there are lots of wizarding
genes, and the more wizard genes you have, the more powerful the wizard you are.
In this case, Hariezer reasons, as powerful wizards marry less powerful wizards,
or non-magical types, the frequency of the magical variant of wizard genes in
the general population becomes diluted.  In this model, two squibs might rarely
manage to have a wizard child, but they are likely to be weaker than wizard-born
wizards. Call this model 1.

The other model Hariezer lays out is that magic lies on a single recessive gene.
He reasons squibs have one dominant, non-magical version, and one recessive
magical version of the gene.  So of kids born to squibs, 1/4 will be wizards.
In this version, you either have magic or you don't, so if wizards married the
non-magical, wizards themselves could become more rare, but the power of wizards
won't be diluted.  Call this model 2.

The proper test between model 1 and 2, suggests Hariezer, is to look at the
children born to two squibs.  If about one fourth of them are wizards, its
evidence of model 2, otherwise, evidence of model 1.

**There is a huge problem with this.  Do you see it?  Here is a hint, What other
predictions does model 2 make?  While you are thinking about it, read on.**

Before I answer the question, I want to point out that Hariezer ignores tons of
other plausible models.  Here is one I just made up.  Imagine, for instance, a
single gene that switches magic on and off, and a whole series of other genes
that make you a better wizard.  Maybe some double-jointed-wrist gene allows you
to move your wand in unusually deft ways.  Maybe some mouth-shape gene allows
you to pronounce magical sounds no one else can.  In this case, magical talent
can be watered down as in model 1, and wizard inheritance could still look like
Mendel would suggest, as in model 2.

**Alright, below I'm going to answer my query above.  Soon there will be no time
to figure it for yourself.**

Squibs are, by definition, the non-wizard children of wizard parents.
Hariezer's model 2 predicts that squibs cannot exist.  It is already empirically
disproven.

Hariezer, of course, does not notice this massive problem with his favored
model, and Draco's collected genealogy suggests about 6 out of 28 squib born
children were wizards, so he declares model 2 wins the test.

Draco flips out, because now that he "knows" that magic isn't being watered down
by breeding he can't join the death eaters and his whole life is ruined,etc.
Hariezer is happy that Draco has "awakened as a scientist."  (I hadn't
complained about the stilted language in awhile, just reminding you that its
still there), but Draco lashes out and casts a torture spell and locks Hariezer
in the dungeon.  After some failed escape attempts, he once against resorts to
the time turner, because even now that its locked down, its the solution to
every problem.

One other thing of note- to investigate the hypothesis that really strong spells
can't be cast anymore, Hariezer tries to look up a strong spell and runs into
"the interdict of Merlin" that strong spells can't be written down, only passed
from wizard to wizard.

Its looking marginally possible that it will turn out that this natural secrecy
is exactly whats killing off powerful magic- its not open so ideas aren't
flourishing or being passed on.  Hariezer will notice that and realize his
"Bayesian Conspiracy" won't be as effective as an open science culture, and I'll
have to take back all of my criticisms around secretive science (it will be a
lesson Hariezer learns, and not an idea Hariezer endorses).  It seems more
likely given the author's existential risk concerns, however, that this
interdict of Merlin will be endorsed.

### Chapter 23- Wizarding genetics made (way too) simple

[more-whales][more-whales_chapter_23_i_think]:

  > I think he just wasn't aware of how squibs work in canon (relevant author's
  > notes, in which he also mentions that he hasn't read all the books, and
  > points out the other scientific mistakes he thinks Harry is making). This is

What else could a squib be though?  I wasn't aware of exactly what a squib was,
I figured out in from context (in this case, the context of HPMOR!, plus
whatever background cultural knowledge is kicking around in my head).

If a squib is just a muggle who knows about the magical world, then the test is
meaningless because there is no way of knowing what gene pattern they have.

Reading that author's note is actually pretty infuriating.  Yudkowsky tells us:

  > What Harry is mainly thinking about at this point is manipulating Draco!

Which goes back to an earlier post of mine- the Harry of this story is not a
scientist at all.  He is a manipulator who thinks science is another means to an
end.  He doesn't care about the actual answer, he cares about manipulating
Draco.  He isn't actually curious about magic, he wants to increase his magic
power.

He also says this:

  > I realize this is going to sound odd, but Harry is not supposed to know all
  > that much science. He's eleven.

Which goes back to another post I've made before- when Yudkowsky gets it right,
the praise goes to Yudkowsky.  When he gets it wrong, its because Harry is
eleven and doesn't know that much science.

### Some more notes regarding HPMOR

There is a line in the movie Clueless (if you aren't familiar, Clueless was an
older generation's Mean Girls) where a woman is described as a "Monet"- in that
like the painting, it looks good from afar but up close is a mess.

So I'm now nearly 25 chapters into this thing, and I'm starting to think that
HPMOR is this sort of a monet- if you let yourself get carried along, it seems
ok-enough.  It references a lot of things that a niche group of people,myself
included, like (physics! computational complexity! genetics! psychology!).  But
as you stare at it more, you start noticing that it doesn't actually hang
together, its a complete mess.

The hard science references are subtly wrong, and often aren't actually
explained in-story (just a jargon dump to say 'look, here is a thing you like').

The social science stuff fairs a bit better (its less wrong ::rimshot::), but
even when its explanation is correct, its power is wildly exaggerated-
conversations between Quirrell/Malfoy/Potter seem to follow scripts of the form

"Here is an awesome manipulation I'm using against you"

"My, that is an effective manipulation. You are a dangerous man"

"I know, but I also know that you are only flattering me as an attempt to
manipulate me."

"My, what an effective use of Bayesian evidence that is!"

Other characters get even worse treatment, either behaving nonsensically to
prove how good Harry is at manipulation (as in the chapter where Harry tells off
Snape and then tries to blackmail the school because Snape asked him questions
he didn't know), OR acting nonsensically so Harry can explain why its
nonsensical ("Carry this rock around for no reason." "Thats actually the fallacy
of privileging the hypothesis.")  The social science/manipulation/marketing
psychology stuff is just a flavoring for conversations.

 No important event in the story has hinged on any of this rationality- instead
 basically every conflict thus far is resolved via the time turner.

And if you strip all this out, all the wrongish science-jargon and the
conversations that serve no purpose but to prove Malfoy/Quirrell/Harry are
"awesome" by having them repeatedly think/tell each other how awesome they are,
the story has no real structure.  Its just a series of poorly paced (if you
strip out the "awesome" conversations, then there are many chapters where
nothing happens), disconnected events.  There is no there there.

### Chapter 24- Evopsych Rorschach test {#ch24}

Evolutionary psychology is a field that famously has a pretty poor bullshit
filter.  Satoshi Kanazawa once published a series of articles that beautiful
people will have more female children (because beauty is more important for
girls) and engineers/mathematicians will have more male children (because only
men need the logic-brains).  The only thing his papers proved was that he is bad
at statistics (in fact, Kanazawa made an entire career out of being bad at
statistics, such is the state of evo-psych).

One of the core criticisms is that for any fact observed in the world, you can
tell several different evolutionary stories, and there is no real way to tell
which, if any is actually true.  Because of this, when someone gives you an
evopsych explanation for something, its often telling you more about what they
believe then it is about science or the world (there are exceptions, but they
are rare).

So this chapter is a long, pretty much useless conversation between Draco and
Hariezer about how they are manipulating each other and Dumbledore or whatever,
but smack in the middle we get this rumination:

  > In the beginning, before people had quite understood how evolution worked,
  > they'd gone around thinking crazy ideas like human intelligence evolved so
  > that we could invent better tools.
  >
  > The reason why this was crazy was that only one person in the tribe had to

What does his preferred explanation for the origin of intelligence (people
evolved to outwit each other) say about the author?

### Chapter 24/25/26 - Mangled Narratives {#ch24-26}

This chapter is going to be entirely about the way the story is being told in
this section of chapters.  There is a big meatball of a terrible idea, but I'm
getting sick of that low hanging fruit, so I'll only mention it briefly in
passing.

I'm a sucker for stories about con artists.  In these stories, there is a
tradition of breaking with the typical chronological order of story telling-
instead they show the end result of the grand plan first, followed by all the
planning that went into it (or some variant of that).  In that way, the audience
gets to experience the climax first from the perspective of the mark, and then
from the perspective of the clever grifters.  Yudkowsky himself successfully
employs this pattern in the first chapter with the time turner.

In this chapter, however, this pattern is badly mangled.  The chapter is setting
up an elaborate prank on Rita Skeeter (Draco warned Hariezer that Rita was
asking questions during one of many long conversations), but jumbling the
narrative accomplishes literally nothing.

Here are the events, in the order laid out in the narrative

1. Hariezer tells Draco he didn't tell on him about the torture, and borrows
   some money from him

2. (this is the terrible idea meatball) Using literally the exact same logic
   that Intelligent Design proponents use (and doing exactly 0 experiments),
   Hariezer decides while thinking over breakfast:

  > Some intelligent engineer, then, had created the Source of Magic, and told
  > it to pay attention to a particular DNA marker.
  >
  > The obvious next thought was that this had something to do with "Atlantis".

3. Hariezer meets with Dumbledore, and refuses to tell on Draco, says getting
   tortured is all part of his manipulation game.

4. Fred and George Weasley meet with a mysterious man named Flume and tells him
   the-boy-who-lived needs the mysterious man's help. There is a Rtia Skeeter
   story mentioned that says Quirrell is secretly a death eater and is training
   Hariezer to be the next dark lord, a story Flume says was planted by the
   elder Malfoy.

5. Quirrell tells Rita Skeeter he has no dark mark, Rita ignores him.

6. Hariezer hires Fred and George (presumably with Malfoy's money) to perpetuate
   a prank on Rita Skeeter- to convince her of something totally false.

7. Hariezer has lunch with Quirrell, reads a newspaper story with the headline

  > HARRY POTTER  
  > SECRETLY BETROTHED  
  > TO GINEVRA WEASLEY  

This is the story the Weasley's planted apparently (the prank), and apparently
there was a lot of supporting evidence or something, because Quirrell is
incredulous it could be done.  And then Quirrell after speculating that Rita
Skeeter could be capable of turning to a small animal, crushes a beetle.

So whats the problem with this narrative order?  First, there is absoltuely no
payoff to jumbling the chronology.  The prank is left until the end, and its
exactly what we expected- a false story was planted in the newspaper. It doesn't
even seem like that big a deal- just a standard gossip column story (of course,
Harry and Quirrell react like its a huge, impossible-to-have-done prank, to be
sure the reader knows its hard.)

Second, most of the scenes are redundant, they contain no new information
whatsoever and they are therefore boring- the event covered in 3 (talking with
Dumbledore) is covered in full in 1 (telling Malfoy he didn't tell on him to
Dumbledore).  The events of 6 (Hariezer hiring the Weasley's to prank for him)
are completely covered in 4 (when the Weasley's hire Flume, they tell him its
for Hariezer).   This chapter is twice as long as it should be, for no reason.

Third, the actual prank is never shown from either the marks or the grifter's
perspective.  It happens entirely off-stage so to speak.  We don't see Rita
Skeeter encountering all this amazing evidence about Hariezer's betrothal and
writing up her career making article.  We don't see Fred and George's elaborate
plan (although if I were a wizard and wanted to plant a false newspaper story,
I'd just plant a false memory in a reporter).

  What would have been more interesting, the actual con happening off-stage, or
  the long conversations about nothing that happen in these chapters?  These
  chapters are just an utter failure.  The narrative decisions are nonsensical,
  and everything continues to be tell, tell, tell, never show.

Also of note- Quirrell gives Hariezer Roger Bacon's diary of magic, because of
course thats a thing that exists.

I haven't read much internet or fan fiction, not because I'm high-brow or above
it (no one who has wasted as much time as I have spent blogging about HPMOR
should ever feel they are above anything), but because I'm a member of that last
generation that didn't grow up with internet, but rather started encountering it
in highschool and college.  It just never occurred to me to seek out fiction on
the internet, until people started recommending HPMOR.

That said, as an adolescent I read probably hundreds of absolutely terrible
fantasy books, and as an adult I've read twice as many absolutely terrible
thrillers, and they are always full of terrible prose, ridiculous dialogue, and
the plots are incredibly formulaic.  But things happen.  If anything the pacing
is awful because its way too fast- plot is the afterthought needed to move from
one action sequence to the next.  In HPMOR, or at least 25 chapters of it, on
the other hand, people talk about things happening.  Almost everything is
tell,tell,tell never show.

I sort of wonder if people who read much faster are processing the book
differently.  If they don't mind that the book is all tell, because everything
to them seems like tell.  It would be interesting to poll people about their
experience of reading, if someone less lazy than me wants to take this sort of
initiative.

Not the bits about magic, obviously, the bits about whether to understand people
we "reconfigure our own brain to act as a model of someone else's?"

Its not clear to me how you would test that.  Its also not clear to me that we
have that level of understanding of what sort of brain activity makes up a
"thought."  I don't think its what it "feels" like when I try to empathize with
or "predict" someone.  I don't even know enough to know how I could look this
up.  Would anyone with some relevant knowledge like to weigh in?

### Chapter 27- Answers from a psychologist

In order to answer last night's science question, I spent today slaving on the
streets, polling professionals for answers (i.e. I sent one email to an old
college roommate who did a doctorate in experimental brain stuff).  This will
basically be a guest post.

Here is the response:

So on this particular bit of science, it looks like Yudkowsky isn't wrong he is
just presenting conjecture and hypothesis as settled science.  Still I learned
something here, I'd never encountered this idea before.  I'll have an actual
post about chapter 27 tomorrow.

### Chapter 27 - Mostly Retreads {#ch27}

This is another chapter where most of the action is stuff that has happened
before, we are getting more and more retreads.

The new bit is that Hariezer is learning to defend himself from mental attacks.
The goal, apparently, is to perfectly simulate someone other than yourself, in
that way the mind reader learns the wrong things.  This leads in to the
full-throated endorsement of the simulation theory of empathy that was discussed
by a professional in my earlier post.  Credit where credit is due- this was an
idea I'd never encountered before, and I do think HPMOR is good for some of
that- if you don't trust the presentation and google ideas as they come up, you
could learn quite a bit.

We also find out Snape is a perfect mind-reader.  This is an odd choice- in the
original books Snape's ability to block mind-reading was something of a metaphor
for his character- you can't know if you can trust him because he is so hard to
read, his inscrutableness even fooled the greatest dark wizard ever, etc.  It
was, fundamentally, hid cryptic dodginess that helped the cause, but it also
fermented the distrust that some of the characters in the story felt toward him.

Now for the retreads-

More pointless bitching about quidditch. Nothing was said here that wasn't said
in the earlier bitching about quidditch.

Snape enlists Hareizer's help to fight anti-slytherin bullies (for no real
reason, near as I can tell), the bullies are fought once more with con-artist
style cleverness (much like in the earlier chapter with the time turner and
invisitbility cloak.  In this chapter, its just with an invisibility cloak).

Snape rewards Hariezer's rescue with a conversation about Hariezer's parents,
during which Hariezer decides his mother was shallow, which upsets Snape.  Its
an odd moment, but the odd moments in HPMOR dialogue have piled up so high its
almost not worth mentioning.

And the chapter culminates when the bullied slytherin tells Hariezer about
Azkaban, pleading with Hariezer to save his parents.  Of course, Hariezer can't
(something tells me he will in the near future), and we get this:

  > "Yeah," said the Boy-Who-Lived, "that pretty much nails it. Every time
  > someone cries out in prayer and I can't answer, I feel guilty about not
  > being God."
  >
  > ...
  >
  > The solution, obviously, was to hurry up and become God.

So another retread- Hariezer is once more making clear his motives aren't
curiosity, they are power.  This was true after chapter 10, its still true now.

This is the only real action for several chapters now, unfortunately all the
action feels like its already happened before in other chapters.

### Chapter 28- Hacking Science/Map-territory {#ch28}

Finally we get back to some attempts to do magi-science, but its again deeply
frustrating.  Its more transfiguration- the only magic we have thus far
explored, and it leads to a discussion of map vs. territory distinctions that is
horribly mangled.

At the opening of hte chapter,  instead of using science to explore magic, the
new approach is to treat magic as a way to hack science itself.  To that end,
Hariezer tries (and fails) to transfigure something into "cure for Alzheimer's,"
and then tries (successfully) to transfigure a rope of carbon nanotubes.  I
guess the thought here is he can then give these things to scientists to study?
Its unclear, really.

Frustrated with how useless this seems, Hermione make this odd complaint:

  > "Anyway," Hermione said. Her voice shook. "I don't want to keep doing this.
  > I don't believe children can do things that grownups can't, that's only in
  > stories."

Poor Hermione- thats the feeblest of objections, especially in a story where
every character acts like they are in their late teens or twenties.  Its almost
as if the author was looking for some knee jerk complaint you could throw out
that everyone would write-off as silly on its face.

So Hariezer decides he needs to do something adults can't to appease Hermione.
To do this, he decides to attack the constraints he knows about magic, starting
with the idea that you can only transfigure a whole object, and not part of an
object (a constraint I think was introduced just for this chapter?).

So Hariezer reasons: things are made out of atoms.  There isn't REALLY a whole
object there,so why can't I do part of an object?  This prompted me to wonder-
if you do transform part of an object, what happens at the interface?  Does this
whole-object constraint have something to do with the interface?  I mentioned in
the chapter 15 section that magicking in a lot large gold molecule into water
could cause steric mismatches (just volume constraints really) with huge energy
differences, hence explosions.  What happens at the micro level when you take
some uniform crystalline solid and try to patch on some organic material like
rubber at some boundary?  If you deform the (now rubbery) material, what happens
when it changes back and the crystal spacing is now messed up?  Could you
partially transform something if you carefully worked out the interface?

It will not surprise someone who has read this far that none of these questions
are asked or answered.

Instead, Hariezer thinks really hard about how atoms are real, in the process we
get ruminations on the map and the territory:

  > But that was all in the map, the true territory wasn't like that, reality
  > itself had only a single level of organization, the quarks, it was a unified
  > low-level process obeying mathematically simple rules.

This seems innocuous enough, but a fundamental mistake is being made here.  For
better or for worse, physics is limited in what it can tell you about the
territory, it can just provide you with more accurate maps.  Often it provides
you with multiple, equivalent maps for the same situation with no way to choose
between them.

For instance, quarks (and gluons) have this weird property- they are well
defined excitations at very high energies, but not at all well-defined at low
energies, where bound states become fundamental excitations.  There is no such
thing as a free-quark at low energy.  For some problems, the quark map is
useful, for many, many more problems the meson/hadron (proton,neutron,kaon,etc)
map is much more useful. The same theory at a different energy scale provides a
radically different map (renormalization is a bitch, and a weak coupling becomes
strong).

Continuing in this vein, he keeps being unable to transform only part of an
object, so he keeps trying different maps, and making the same map/territory
confusion culminating in:

  > If he wanted power, he had to abandon his humanity, and force his thoughts
  > to conform to the true math of quantum mechanics.
  >
  > There were no particles, there were just clouds of amplitude in a
  > multiparticle configuration space and what his brain fondly imagined to be
  > an eraser was nothing except a gigantic factor in a wavefunction that
  > happened to factorize,

(Side note: for Hariezer its all about power, not about curiosity, as I've said
dozens of time now.  Also, I know as much physics as anyone, and I don't think
I've abandoned my humanity.)

This is another example of the same problem I'm getting at above.  There is no
"true math of quantum mechanics."   In non-relativistic, textbook quantum
mechanics, I can formulate one version of quantum mechanics on 3 space dimension
1 time dimension, and calculate things via path integrals.  I can also build a
large configuration space (Hilbert space) with 3 space dimensions, and 3
momentum dimensions per particle, (and one overall time dimension) and calculate
things via operators on that space.  These are different mathematical
formulations, over different spaces, that are completely equivalent.  Neither
map is more appropriate than the other.  Hariezer arbitrarily thinks of
configuration space as the RIGHT one.

This isn't unique to quantum mechanics, most theories have several radically
different formulations.  Good old newtonian mechanics has a formulation on the
exact same configuration space Hariezer is thinking of.

The big point here is that the same theory has different mathematical
formulations.  We don't know which is "the territory" we just have a bunch of
different, but equivalent maps.  Each map has its own strong suits, and its not
clear that any one of them is the best way to think about all problems.  Is
quantum mechancis 3+1 dimensions (3 space, 1 time) or is it 6N+1 (3 space and 3
momentum + 1 time dimension)? Its both and neither (more appropriately, its just
not a question that physics can answer for us).

What Hariezer is doing here isn't separating the map and the territory, its
reifying one particular map (configuration space)!

(Less important: I also find it amusing, in a physics elitist sort of way (sorry
for the condescension) that Yudkowsky picks non-relativistic quantum mechanics
as the final, ultimate reality.  Instead of describing or even mentioning
quantum field theory, which is the most low-level theory we (we being science)
know of, Yudkowsky picks non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the most low-level
theory HE knows.)

Anyway, despite obviously reifying a map, in-story it must be the "right" map,
because suddenly he manages to transform part of an object, although he tells
Hermione

  > Quantum mechanics wasn't enough," Harry said. "I had to go all the way down
  > to timeless physics before it took.

So this is more bad pedagogy: timeless physics isn't even a map, its the idea of
a map.  No one has made a decent formulation of quantum mechanics without a
specified time direction (technical aside: its very hard to impose unitarity
sensibly if you are trying to make time emerge from your theory, instead of
being inbuilt).  Its pretty far away from mainstream theory attempts, but here
its presented as the ultimate idea in physics.  It seems very odd to just toss
in a somewhat obscure ideas as the pinnacle of physics.

Anyway, Hariezer shows Dumbledore and McGonagall his new found ability to
transfigure part of an object, chapter ends.

### bartlebyshop: I suspect this is ...

Oh, its already made a small appearance.  In my post ["Chapter 14 continued-
Comed Tea, Newcomb's Problem, Science"](#), _[Ed. This post is lost, so no
useful link.]_ I mentioned that Yudkowsky was using his "comed-tea" magical
invention as a backdoor future-causes-the-past idea.  I'd bet a lifetime of
scotch timeless decision theory shows up before this thing is done.

### Chapter 29- Not Much Here {#ch29}

Someone called Yudkowsky out on the questionable decision to include his pet
theories as established science, so chapter 29 opens with this (why didn't he
stick this disclaimer on the chapters where the mistakes were made?):

  > Science disclaimers: Luosha points out that the theory of empathy in Ch. 27

  > either.

He is still wrong about timeless formulations of quantum though, they aren't
more elegant, they don't exist.

The rest of this chapter seems like its just introductory for something coming
later- Hariezer, Draco and Hermione are all named as heads of Quirrell's armies
and are all trying to manipulate each other. Some complaints from Hermione that
broomstick riding is jock-like and stupid, old hat by now.

There, is however, one exceptionally strange bit- apparently in this version of
the world, the core plot of Prisoner of Azkaban (Scabbers the rat was really
Peter Petigrew) was just a delusion that a schizophrenic Weasley brother had.
Just a stupid swipe at the original book for no real reason.

### Chapter 30-31 - Credit Where Credit is Due {#ch30-31}

So credit where credit is due- these two chapters are pretty decent.  We finally
get some action in a chapter, there is only one bit of wrongish science, and the
overall moral of the episode is a good one.

In these chapters, three teams, "armies" lead by Draco, Hariezer and Hermione,
compete in a mock-battle, Quirrell's version of a team sport.  The action is
more less competently written (despite things like having Neville yell "special
attack"), and its more-or-less fun and quick to read.  It feels a bit like a
lighter-hearted version of the beginning competitions of Ender's game (which no
doubt inspired these chapters.

The overall "point" of the chapters is even pretty valuable- Hermione, who is
written off as an idiot by both Draco and Hariezer splits her army and has half
attack Draco and half attack Hariezer. She is seemingly wiped out almost
instantly.  Draco and Hariezer then fight each other nearly to death, and out
pops Hermione's army- turns out they only faked defeat.  Hermione wins, and we
learn that unlike Draco and Hariezer, Hermione delegated and collaborated with
the rest of her team to develop strategies to win the fight.  There is a (very
unexpected given the tone of everything thus far) lesson about teamwork and
collaboration here.

Thats said- I still have nits to pick.  Hariezer's army is organized in quite
possibly the dumbest possible way:

  > Harry had divided the army into 6 squads of 4 soldiers each, each squad
  > commanded by a Squad Suggester. All troops were under strict orders to
  > disobey any orders they were given if it seemed like a good idea at the
  > time, including that one... unless Harry or the Squad Suggester prefixed the
  > order with "Merlin says", in which case you were supposed to actually obey.

This might seem like a good idea, but anyone who has played team sports can
testify- there is a reason that you work out plays in advance, and generally
have delineated roles.  I assume the military has a chain of command for similar
reasons, though I have never been a solider.  I was hoping to see this idea for
a creatively-disorganized army bite Hariezer, but it does not.  There seems to
be no confusion at all over orders, etc.  Basically, none of what you'd expect
would happen from telling an army "do what you want, disobey all orders"
happens.

And it wouldn't be HPMOR without potentially bad social science, here is today's
reference:

Now, I readily admit to not having read the original Robber's Cave book, but I
do have two textbooks that reference it, and Yudkowsky gets the overall shape of
the study right, but fails to mention some important details. (If my books are
wrong, and Yudkowsky is right, which seems highly unlikely given his track
record please let me know)

Both descriptions I have suggest the experiment had 3 stages, not two.  The
first stage was to build up the in-groups, then the second stage was to
introduce them to each other and build conflict, and then the third stage was
to try and resolve the conflict. In particular, this aside from Yudkowsky
originally struck me as surprising insightful:

  > They'd named themselves the Eagles and the Rattlers (they hadn't needed
  > names for themselves when they thought they were the only ones in the park)

Unfortunately, its simply not true- during phase 1 the researchers asked the
groups to come up with names for themselves, and let the social norms for the
groups develop on their own. _The "in-group" behavior developed before they met
their rival groups._

While tensions existed from first meeting, real conflicts didn't develop until
the two groups competed in teams for valuable prizes.

This stuff matters- Yudkowsky paints a picture of humans diving so easily into
tribes that simply setting two groups of boys loose in the same park will cause
trouble.  In reality, taking two groups of boys, encouraging them to develop
group habits, group names, group customs, and then setting the groups to
directly competing for scarce prizes (while researchers encourage the growth of
conflicts) will cause conflicts.  This isn't just a subtlety.

### Chapter 32- Interlude {#ch32}

Chapter 32 is just a brief interlude, nothing here really, just felt the need to
put this in for completeness.

### Chapter 33- it worked so well the first time, might as well try it again {#ch33}

This chapter has left me incredibly frustrated.  After a decent chapter, we get
a terrible retread of the same thing.  For me, this chapter failed so hard that
I'm actually feeling sort of dejected, it undid any good will the previous
battle chapter had built up.

This section of chapters is basically a retread of the dueling armies just a
brief section back.  Unfortunately, this second battle section flubs completely
a lot of the things that worked pretty well in the first battle section. There
is a lot to talk about here that I think failed, so this might be long.

There is an obvious huge pacing problem here.  The first battle game happens
just a brief interlude before the second battle game.  Instead of spreading this
game out over the course of the Hogwarts school year (or at least putting a few
of the other classroom episodes in between) these just get slammed together.
First battle, one interlude, last battle. That means that a lot of the evolution
of the game over time, how people are reacting to it, etc. is left as a tell
rather than a show. A lot of this chapter is spent dealing with big changes to
Hogwarts that have been developing as student's get super-involved in this
battle game, but we never see any of that.

Imagine if Ender's game (a book fresh on my mind because of the incredibly
specific references in this chapter) were structured so that you get the first
battle game, and then a flash-forward to his final battle against the aliens,
with Ender explaining all the strategy he learned over the rest of that year.
This chapter is about as effective as that last Ender's game battle would be.

The chapter opens with Dumbledore and McGonagall worried about the school-

  > Students were wearing armbands with insignia of fire or smile or upraised
  > hand, and hexing each other in the corridors.

Loyalty to armies over house or school is tearing the school apart!

But then we turn to the army generals- apparently the new rules of the game
allowed soldiers in armies to turn traitor, and its caused the whole game to
spiral out of control- Draco complains:

  > You can't possibly do any real plots with all this stuff going on. Last
  > battle, one of my soldiers faked his own suicide.

Hermione agrees, everyone is losing control of their armies because of all the
traitors.

"But.. wait..." I can hear you asking, "how can that make sense?  Loyalty to the
armies is so absolute people are hexing each other in the corridors? But at the
same time, almost all the students in the armies are turning traitor and
plotting against their generals?  Both of those can't be true?"  I agree, you
smart reader you, both of these things don't work together.   NOT ONLY  IS
YUDKOWSKY TELLING INSTEAD OF SHOWING, WE ARE BEING TOLD CONTRADICTORY THINGS.
Yudkowsky wanted to be able to follow through on the Robber's Cave idea he
developed earlier, but he also needed all these traitors for his plot, so he
tried to run in both directions at once.

Thats not the only problem with this chapter (it wouldn't be HPMOR without
misapplied science/math concepts)- it turns out Hermione is winning, so the only
way for Draco and Hariezer to try to catch up is to temporarily team up, which
leads to a long explanation where Hariezer explains the prisoner's dilemma and
Yudkowsky's pet decision theory.

Here is the big problem- In the classic prisoner's dilemma:

If my partner cooperates, I can either:

-cooperate, in which case I spend a short time in jail, and my partner spends a
short time in jail

-defect, in which case I spend no time in jail, and my partner serves a long
time in jail

If my partner defects, I can either:

-cooperate, in which case I spend a long time in jail, and my partner goes free

-defect, in which case I spend a long time in jail, as does my partner.

The key insight of the prisoner's dilemma is that no matter what my partner
does, defecting improves my situation. This leads to a dominant strategy where
everyone defects, even though the both-defect is worse than the both-cooperate.

In the situation between Draco and Hariezer:

If Draco cooperates, Hariezer can either:

-cooperate in which case both Hariezer and Draco both have a shot at getting
first or second

-defect, in which case Hariezer is guaranteed second, Draco guaranteed 3rd place

If Draco defects, Hariezer can either

-cooperate, in which case Hariezer is guaranteed 3rd, and Draco gets 2nd.

-defect, in which case Hariezer and Draco are fighting it out for 2nd and third.

Can you see the difference here?  If Draco is expected to cooperate, Hariezer
has no incentive to defect- both cooperate is STRICTLY BETTER than the situation
where Hariezer defects against Draco.  _This is not at all a prisoner's dilemma,
its just cooperating against a bigger threat._  All the pontificating about
decision theories that Hariezer does is just wasted breath, because no one is in
a prisoner's dilemma.

After the pointless digression about the non-prisoner's dilemma (seriously, this
is getting absurd, and frustrating- I'm hard pressed to find a single science
reference in this whole thing that's unambiguously applied correctly.).

After these preliminaries, the battle begins.  Unlike the light hearted, winking
reference to Ender's game of the previous chapter, Yudkowsky feels the need to
make it totally explicit-  they fight in the lake, so that Hariezer can use
exactly the stuff he learned from Ender's game to give him an edge.  It turns
the light homage of the last battle into just the setup for the
beat-you-over-the-head reference this time.  There is a benefit to subtlety, and
assuming your reader isn't an idiot.

Anyway, during the battle, everyone betrays everyone and the overall competition
ends in a tie.

### Some more notes regarding HPMOR

[kai-skai][kai-skai_some_more_notes_hpmor_fan]:

  > HPMOR fan, fast reader here - I noticed some of the stuff OP was talking

To be clear, the criticism isn't that there are pointless scenes- its that if
you strip out the places where everyone acts silly to be a foil for Harry, or
the self-referential conversations about manipulating each other, or the
flat-out wrong science, there are chapters where there is literally nothing else
left in the chapter.  No ideas, no conversation, just nothing.

More specific criticism can be found on my tumblr, where I'm live blogging my
reading experience.

### Can't you stop being so uptight and pedantic and just enjoy a good story?

No

### HPMOR Chapter 1

[kai-skai][kai-skai_hpmor_chapter_1_im_sorry]:

  > (I'm sorry, I'm probably not going to do this for every chapter you reviewed
  > or anything, but you directed me to your reviews so I'll nitpick a little!)

Honestly, I appreciate any engagement you want to make.  Its somewhat flattering
that anyone would read my reaction to a fanfic at all.  Respond to any chapter,
every chapter, whatever you please.

I'll probably not respond to everything, for fear of creating an infinite chain
of tangents, but if you feel there is anything egregious, and people who read my
tumblr need a second opinion, let me know and I'll be sure to reblog it.

### Chapter 34-35 Aftermath of the War Game {#ch34-35}

These chapters contain a lot of speechifying, but in this case it actually fits,
as a resolution to the battle game.  Its expected and isn't overly long.

The language, as throughout, is still horribly stilted, but I think I'm getting
used to it (when Hariezer referred to Hermione as "General of Sunshine" I almost
went right past it without a mental complaint).  Basically, I'm likely to stop
complaining about the stilted language but its still there, its always there.

Angry at the ridiculousness of the traitors, Hemione and Draco insist that if
Hariezer uses traitors in his army that they will team up and destroy him.  He
insists he will keep using them.

Next, Quirrell gives a long speech about how much chaos the traitors were able
to create, and makes an analogy to the death eaters.  He insists that the only
way to guard against such is essentially fascism.

Hariezer than speaks up, and says that you can do just as much damage in the
hunt for traitors as traitors can do themselves, and stands up for a more open
society.  The themes of these speeches can be found in probably hundreds of
books, but they work well enough here.

Every army leader gets a wish, Draco and Hermione decide to wish for their
houses to win the house cup.  In an attempt to demonstrate his argument for
truth, justice and the American way, Hariezer wishes for quidditch to no longer
contain the snitch.  I guess nothing will rally students around an open society
like one person fucking with the sport they love.

We also find out that Dumbledore helped the tie happen by aiding in the
plotting(the plot was "too complicated" for any student, according to Quirrell,
so it must have been Dumbledore- apparently, 'betray everyone to keep the score
close' is a genius master plan), but we are also introduced to a mysterious
cloaked stranger who was also involved but wiped all memory of his passing.

These are ok chapters, as HPMOR chapters go.

### Hariezer's Arrogance

In response to some things that kai-skai has said, I started thinking about how
should we view Hariezer's arrogance.  Should we view it as a character flaw?
Something Hariezer will grow and overcome?  I don't think its being presented
that way.

My problem with the arrogance are several:

-the author intends for Hariezer to be a teacher.  He is supposed to be the
master rationalist that the reader (and other characters) learn from.  His
arrogance makes that off-putting.  If you aren't familiar at all with the topics
Hariezer happens to be discussing, you are being condescended to along with the
characters in the story (although if you know the material you get to condescend
to the simpletons along with Hariezer).  Its just a bad pedagogical choice.  You
don't teach people by putting them on the defensive.

-The arrogance is not presented by the author as a character flaw. In the story,
its not a flaw to overcome, its part of what makes him "awesome."  His arrogance
has not harmed him, he hasn't felt the need to revisit it.  When he thinks he
knows better than everyone else, the story invariably proves him right.  He
hasn't grown or been presented with a reason to grow.  I would bet a great deal
of money that Hariezer ends HPMOR exactly the same arrogant twerp he starts as.

-This last one is a bit of a personal reaction.  Hariezer gets a lot of science
wrong (I think all of it is wrong, actually, up to where I am now), and is
incredibly arrogant while doing so.  I've taught a number of classes at the
college level, and I've had a lot of confidently, arrogantly wrong students.
Hariezer's attitude and lack of knowledge repeatedly remind me of the worst
students I ever had- smart kids too arrogant to learn (and these were physics
classes, where wrong or right is totally objective).

### Chapter 36/37 - Christmas Break/Not much happens {#ch36-37}

Like all the Harry Potter books, Yudkowsky includes a Christmas break.  I note
that a Christmas break would make a lot of sense toward the middle of the book,
not less than &lt;1/3 of the way through.  Like the original books, this is just a
light bit of relaxation

Not a lot happens over break.  Hariezer is a twerp who think his parents don't
respect him enough, they go to Hermione's house for Christmas, Hariezer yells at
Hermione's parents for not respecting her intelligence enough, the parents say
Hermione and Hariezer are like an old married couple (it would have been nice to
see the little bonding moments in the earlier chapters).  Quirrell visits
Hariezer on Christmas Eve.

### Chapter 38 - a cryptic conversation, not much here {#ch38}

This whole chapter is just a conversation between Malfoy and Hariezer.  It fits
squarely into the "one party doesn't really know what the conversation is about"
mold, with Hariezer being the ignorant party.  Malfoy is convinced Hariezer is
working with someone other than Quirrell or Dumbledore.

### Chapter 39- your transhumanism is showing {#ch39}

This was a rough chapter, in which primarily Hariezer and Dumbledore have an
argument about death.  Hariezer takes up the transhumanist position.  If you
aren't familiar with the transhumanist position on death, its basically that
death is bad (duh!) and that the world is full of deathists who have convinced
themselves that death is good.  This usually leads into the idea that some
technology will save us from death (nanotech, [SENS][sens_wiki],etc), and even
if they don't we can all just freeze our corpses to be reanimated when that
whole death thing gets solved.  I find this position somewhat childish, as I'll
try and get to.

So, as a word of advice to future transhumanist authors who want to write
literary screeds arguing against the evil deathists, FANTASY LITERATURE IS A
UNIQUELY BAD CHOICE FOR ARGUING YOUR POINT.  To be fair, Yudkowsky noticed this,
and lampshaded it, when Hariezer says there is no afterlife, Dumbledore argues
back with:

  > "How can you not believe it? " said the Headmaster, looking completely
  > flabbergasted. "Harry, you're a wizard! You've seen ghosts! " ...And if not
  > ghosts, then what of the Veil? What of the Resurrection Stone?"

i.e. how can you not believe in an afterlife with there _is a literal gateway to
the fucking afterlife sitting in the ministry of magic basement._  Hariezer
attempts to argue his way out of this, we get this story for instance:

  > You know, when I got here, when I got off the train from King's Cross...I
  > wasn't expecting ghosts. So when I saw them, Headmaster, I did something
  > really dumb. I jumped to conclusions. I, I thought there wasan afterlife... I
  > thought I could meet my parents who died for me, and tell them that I'd
  > heard about their sacrifice and that I'd begun to call them my mother and
  > father -
  >
  > "And then... asked Hermione and she said that they were just afterimages...
  > And I should have known! I should have known without even having to ask! I
  > shouldn't have believed it even for all of thirty seconds!... And that was
  > when I knew that my parents were really dead and gone forever and ever, that
  > there wasn't anything left of them, that I'd never get a chance to meet them
  > and, and, and the other children thought I was crying because I was scared
  > of ghosts

So, first point- _this could have been a pretty powerful moment if Yudkowsky had
actually structured the story to relate this WHEN HARIEZER FIRST MET A GHOST.
Instead, the first we hear of it is this speech._  Again, tell, tell, tell,
never show

Second point- what exactly does Hariezer assume is being "afterimaged?"  Clearly
some sort of personality, something not physical is surviving in the wizarding
world after death.  If fighting death is this important to Hariezer, why hasn't
he even attempted to study ghosts yet?  (full disclosure, I am an atheist
personally.  However, if I lived in a world WITH ACTUAL MAGIC, LITERAL GHOSTS, a
stone that resurrects the dead, and a FUCKING GATEWAY TO THE AFTERLIFE I might
revisit that position).

Here is Hariezer's response to the gateway to the afterlife:

  > That doesn't even sound like an interesting fraud," Harry said, his voice
  > calmer now that there was nothing there to make him hope, or make him angry
  > for having hopes dashed. "Someone built a stone archway, made a little black
  > rippling surface between it that Vanished anything it touched, and enchanted
  > it to whisper to people and hypnotize them."

Do you see how incurious Hariezer is?  If someone told me there was a LITERAL
GATEWAY TO THE AFTERLIFE I'd want to see it.  I'd want to test it, see it.  Can
we try to record and amplify the whispers? Are things being said?

Why do they think its a gateway to the afterlife? Who built it?  Minimally, this
could have lead to a chapter where Hariezer debunks wizarding spiritualists like
a wizard-world Houdini.  (Houdini spent a great deal of his time exposing
mediums and psychics who 'contacted the dead' as frauds.)  I'm pretty sure I
would have even enjoyed a chapter like that.

In the context of the wizarding world, there is all sorts of non-trivial
evidence for an afterlife that simply doesn't exist in the real world.  Its just
a bad choice to present these ideas in the context of this story.

Anyway, ignoring what a bad choice it is to argue against an afterlife in the
context of fantasy fiction, lets move on:

Dumbledore presents some dumb arguments so that Hariezer can seem wise.
Hariezer tells us death is the most frightening thing imaginable, its not
good,etc.  Basically, death is scary, no one should have to die.  If we had all
the time imaginable we would actually use it.   Pretty standard stuff,
Dumbledore drops the ball presenting any real arguments.

So I'll take up Dumbledore's side of the argument.  I have some bad news for
Hariezer's philosophy.  You are going to die.  I'm going to die.  Everyone is
going to die.  It sucks, and its unfortunate, sure, but there is no way around
it.  _Its not a choice! We aren't CHOOSING death._ Even if medicine can replace
your body (which doesn't seem likely in my lifetime), the sun will explode some
day.  Even if we get away from the solar system, eventually we'll run out of
free energy in the universe.

But you do have one choice regarding death- you can accept that you'll die
someday, or you can convince yourself there is some way out.  Convince yourself
that if you say the right prayers, or in the Less Wrong case, work on the right
decision theory to power an AI you'll get to live forever.  Convince yourself
that if you give a life insurance policy to the amateur biologists that run
croynics organizations you'll be reanimated.

The problem with the second choice is that there is an opportunity cost- time
spent praying or working on silly decision theories is time that you aren't
doing things that might _matter to other humans_.  We accept death to be more
productive in life.  Stories about accepting death aren't saying death is good
they are saying death is inevitable.

Edit: I take back a bit about cognitive dissonance that was here.

### Chapter 18 - What?

[kai-skai][kai-skai_chapter_18_what_uh_i_have]:

  > Uh, I have to firmly side with Harry on this one: being good at something
  > doesn't mean you get a free pass for terrifying students. (I mean, this is
  > the teacher who canonically is a student's absolute greatest fear. Sorry,
  > but no.)

Snape's job is to _teach students_ potions.  It isn't to avoid intimidating
students with hard questions (about potions).

There is a hard-assed teacher, or coach or whatever who is the student's
"greatest fear" at pretty much any school.  What would (realistically) happen if
someone  famous threw a two-year-old temper tantrum like Hariezer did?
Seriously, look at what Snape actually does to Hariezer in that chapter- he asks
some questions Hariezer doesn't know the answer to, and makes a sarcastic
comment, that's it.

As anyone who has taught knows, the situation where Hariezer "wins" here is
insane- he would have been disciplined.  You don't get to walk out of a
classroom and stay in the school without repercussion.  A student doesn't get to
decide the rules don't apply to them.  A blackmail threat would have resulted in
more discipline, not everyone caving.   And if "the boy-who-lived" had thrown a
temper tantrum like that and then gone to the newspapers, the story would be
"Boy-Who-Lived Spoiled Brat." Read that chapter from the mind of someone who has
been a teacher before.

Its just a ludicrous series of events, everyone is acting insane.

  > tell me if these get annoying for you.

As I said earlier, I'll always read responses, but only rarely reply to them.  I
don't want to send things to far down tangents.

### Chapter 40- Short Follow Up to 39 {#ch40}

Instead of Dumbledore's views, in this chapter we get Quirrell's view of death.
He agrees with Hariezer, unsurprisingly.

### Chapter 41- Another round of Quirrell's battle game {#ch41}

It seems odd that AFTER the culminating scene, the award being handed out, and
the big fascist vs. freedom speechifying that we have yet another round of
Quirrell's battle game.

Draco and Hermione are now working together against Hariezer.  Through a series
of circumstances, Draco has to drop Hermione off a roof to win.

Edit: I also point out that we don't actually get details of the battle in this
time, it opens with

  > Only a single soldier now stood between them and Harry, a Slytherin boy
  > named Samuel Clamons, whose hand was clenched white around his wand, held
  > upward to sustain his Prismatic Wall.

We then get a narrator summary of the battle that had lead up that moment.
Again, tell, tell, tell never show.

### Chapter 42- Is there a point to this? {#ch42}

Basically an extraneous chapter, but one strange detail at the end.

So in this chapter, Hariezer is worried that its his fault that in the battle
last chapter.  Hermione got dropped off a roof.  Hermione agrees to forgive him
as long as he lets Draco drop him off the same roof.

He takes a potion to help him fall slowly and is dropped, but so many young
girls try to summon him to their arms (yes, this IS what happens) that he ends
up falling, luckily Remus Lupin is there to catch him.

Afterwards, Remus and Hariezer talk.  Hariezer learns that his father was
something of a bully.  And, for some reason, that Peter Petigrew and Sirius
Black were lovers.  Does anyone know what the point of making Petigrew and Black
lovers would be?

### Conversations

My girlfriend: "What have you been working on over there?"

Me: "Uhhhh... so.... there is this horrible Harry Potter fan fiction... you know,
when people on the internet write more stories about Harry Potter? Yea, that.
Anyway, this one is pretty terrible so I thought I'd read it and complain about
it on the internet.... So I'm listening to me say this out loud and it sounds
ridiculous, but.. well, it IS ridiculous... but..."

### Chapter 43-46 Subtle Metaphors {#ch43-46}

These chapters actually moved pretty decently.  When Yudkowsky isn't writing
dialogue, his prose style can actually be pretty workman-like.  Nothing that
would get you to stop and marvel at the word play, but it keeps the pace brisk
and moving.

Now, in JK Rowling's original books, it always seemed to me that the dementors
were a (not-so-subtle) nod to depression.  They leave people wallowing in their
worst memories, low energy, unable to remember the happy thoughts,etc.

In HPMOR, however, Hariezer (after initially failing to summon a patronus)
decides that the dementors really represent death.  You see in HPMOR, instead of
relieving their saddest, most depressing memories the characters just see a
bunch of rotting corpses when the dementors get near.

This does, of course, introduce new questions?  What does it mean that the
dementors guard Azkaban?  Why don't the prisoner's instantly die? Why doesn't a
dementor attack just flat-out kill you?

Anyway, apparently the way to kill death is to just imagine that someday humans
will defeat death, in appropriately Carl Sagan-esque language:

  > The Earth, blazing blue and white with reflected sunlight as it hung in
  > space, amid the black void and the brilliant points of light. It belonged
  > there, within that image, because it was what gave everything else its
  > meaning. The Earth was what made the stars significant, made them more than
  > uncontrolled fusion reactions, because it was Earth that would someday
  > colonize the galaxy, and fulfill the promise of the night sky.
  >
  > Would they still be plagued by Dementors, the children's children's
  > children, the distant descendants of humankind as they strode from star to
  > star? No. Of course not. The Dementors were only little nuisances, paling
  > into nothingness in the light of that promise; not unkillable, not
  > invincible, not even close.

Once you know this, your patronus becomes a human, and kills the dementor.  _Get
it THE PATRONUS IS HUMANS (represented in this case by a human) and THE DEMENTOR
IS DEATH.  Humans defeat death._  Very subtle.

Another large block of chapters with no science.

### Chapter 47 Racism is Bad {#ch47}

Nothing really objectionable here, just more conversations and plotting.

Hariezer spends much of this chapter explaining to Draco that racism is bad, and
that a lot of pure bloods probably hate mudbloods because it gives them a chance
to feel superior.  Hariezer suggests these racist ideas are poisoning slytherin.

We also find out that Draco and his father seem to believe that Dumbledore
burned Draco's mother alive.  This is clearly a departure from the original
books. Hariezer agrees to take as an enemy whoever killed Draco's mother.  Feels
like it'll end up being more plots-within-plots stuff.

Another chapter with no science explored. We do find out Hariezer speaks snake
language.

### Chapter 48 - Utilitarianism {#ch48}

This chapter is actually solid as far as these things go.  After learning he can
talk to snakes Hariezer begins to wonder if all animals are sentient, after all
snakes can talk.  This has obvious implications for meat eating.

From there, he begins to wonder if plants might be sentient, in which case he
wouldn't be able to eat anything at all.  This leads him to the library for
research.

He also introduces scope insensitivity and utilitarianism, even though it isn't
really required at all to explain his point to Hermione.  Hermione asks why he
is freaking out, and instead of answering "I don't want to eat anything that
thinks and talks," he says stuff like

  > "Look, it's a question of multiplication, okay? There's a lot of plants in
  > the world, if they'renot sentient then they're not important, but if plants
  > are people then they've got more moral weight than all the human beings in
  > the world put together. Now, of course your brain doesn't realize that on an
  > intuitive level, but that's because the brain can't multiply. Like if you
  > ask three separate groups of Canadian households how much they'll pay to
  > save two thousand, twenty thousand, or two hundred thousand birds from dying
  > in oil ponds, the three groups will respectively state that they're willing
  > to pay seventy-eight, eighty-eight, and eighty dollars. No difference, in
  > other words. It's called scope insensitivity.

Is that really the best way to describe his thinking?  Why say something with 10
words while several hundred will do.  What does scope insensitivity have to do
with the idea "I don't want to eat things that talk and think?"

**Everything below here is unrelated to HPMOR and has more to do with scope
insensitivity as a concept:**

Now, because I have taught undergraduates intro physics, I do wonder (and have
in the past)- is Kahneman's scope insensitivity related to the general
innumeracy of most people?  i.e. how many people who hear that question just
mentally replace literally any number with "a big number"?

The first time I taught undergraduates I was surprised to learn that most of the
students had no ability to judge if their answers seemed plausible.  I began
adding a question "does this answer seem order of magnitude correct?"  I'd also
take off more points for answers that were the wrong order of magnitude, unless
the student put a note saying something like "I know this is way too big, but I
can't find my mistake."

 You could ask a question about a guy throwing a football, and answers would
 range from 1 meter/second all the way to 5000 meters/second.  You could ask a
 question about how far someone can hit a baseball and answers would similarly
 range from a few meters to a few kilometers.  No one would notice when answers
 were wildly wrong.  Lest someone think this is a units problem (Americans
 aren't used to metric units), even if I forced them to convert to miles per
 hour, miles, or feet students couldn't figure out if the numbers were the right
 order of magnitude.

So I began to give a few short talks on what I thought as basic numeracy.
Create mental yardsticks (the distance from your apartment to campus might be
around a few miles, the distance between this shitty college town and the
nearest actual city might be around a few hundred miles,etc).  When you
encounter unfamiliar problems, try to relate it back to familiar ones.  Scale
the parameters in equations so you have dimensionless quantities * yardsticks
you understand.  And after being explicitly taught most of the students got
better at understanding the size of numbers.

Since I began working in the business world I've noticed that most people never
develop that skill.  Stick a number in a sentence and people just mentally run
right over it, you might as well have inserted some klingon phrases.  Some of
the better actuaries do have some nice numerical intuition, but a surprising
number don't.  They can calculate, but they don't understand what the
calculations are really telling them, like Searle's chinese room but with
numbers.

In Kahneman's scope neglect questions, there are big problems with innumeracy-
if you ask people how much they'd spend on X where X is any charity that seems
importantish, you are likely to get an answer of around $100.  In some sense, it
is scope neglect, in another sense you just max out people's generosity/spending
cash really quickly.

If your rephrase it to "how much should the government spend" you hit general
innumeracy problems, and you also hit general innumeracy problems when you
specify large, specific numbers of birds.

I suspect Kahneman would have gotten different results had he asked his
questions varying questions as: "what percentage of the federal government's
wildlife budget should be spent preventing disease for birds in your city?" vs.
"what percentage of the federal government's wildlife budget should be spent
preventing disease for birds in your state?" vs. "what percentage of the federal
government's wildlife budget should be spent preventing disease for birds in the
whole country?" (I actually ran this experiment on a convenience sample of
students in a 300 level physics class several years ago and got 5%,8% and 10%
respectively, but the differences weren't significant, though the trend was
suggestive.)

I suspect the problem isn't that "brains can't multiply" so much as "most people
are never taught how to think about numbers."

If anyone knows of further literature on this, feel free to pass it my way.

### The next section of HPMOR...

... is a 12 chapter block.  I have a fresh bottle of lagavulin and I'm caught up
on work.  LETS DO THIS.

### Chapter 49- Not much here {#ch49}

I thought I posted something about this last weekend, I think tumblr are it.  So
this will be particularly light.  Hariezer notices that Quirrell knows too much
(phrased as "his priors are too good") but hasn't yet put it together that
Quirrell.

### Chapter 50- In Need of an Editor {#ch50}

So this is basically a complete rehash again- it fits into the "Hariezer uses
the time turner and the invisibility cloak to solve bullying" mold we've already
seen a few times.  The time turner + invisibility cloak is the solution to all
problems, and when Yudkowsky needs a conflict, he throws in bullying.  I think
we've seen this exact conflict with this exact solution at least three other
times.

In this chapter, its Hermione being bullied, he protects her by creating an
alibi with his timer turner, dressing in an invisibility cloak, and whispering
some wisdom in the bullies ear.  Because most bullies just need the wisdom of an
eleven year old whispered into their ear.

There is also (credit where credit is due) a clever working in of the second
book into Yudkowsky's world.  The "interdict of Merlin" Yudkowsky invented
prevents wizards from writing spells down, so Slytherin's basilisk was placed in
Hogwarts to pass spells on to "the heir of Slytherin."  Voldemort learned those
secets and then killed the basilisk, so Hariezer has no shortcut to powerful
spells.

### For those who have read HPMOR

What chapters contain the actual science experiments where Hariezer explores and
begins to figure out the rules of magic?

What I'm looking for are the explorations of the "physics of magic" of this
world Yudkowsky has created.  So far, there has been very little of this, maybe

### Chapter 51-63 Economy of Language {#ch51-63}

So this block of chapters is roughly the length of the Maltese Falcon or the
first Harry Potter book, probably 2/3 the length of the Hobbit.  This one
relatively straight-forward episode of this story is the length of The Maltese
Falcon.  Basically, the ratio of things-happening/words-written is terrible.

This chapter amounts to a prison break- Quirrell tells Hariezer that Bellatrix
Black was innocent, so they are going to break her out.  Its a weird section,
given how Black escaped in the original novels (i.e. the dementors sided with
the dark lord, so all he had to do was go to the dementors say "you are on my
side, please let out bellatrix black, and everyone else while you are at it.")

The plan is to have Hariezer use his patronus while Quirrell travels in snake
form in his pouch.  They'll replace Bellatrix with a corpse, so everyone will
just think she is dead.  It becomes incredibly clear upon meeting Bellatrix that
she wasn't "innocent" at all, though she might be not guilt in the
by-reason-of-insanity sense.

This doesn't phase Hariezer, they just keep moving forward with the plan, which
goes awry pretty quickly when an auror stumbles on them.  Quirrell ties to kill
the auror. Hariezer tries to block the killing spell and ends up knocking out
Quirrell and turning his patronus off, and the plan goes to hell.

To escape, Hariezer first scares the dementors off by threatening to blast them
with his uber-patronus (even death is apparently scared of death in this story).
Then Quirrell wakes up, and with Quirrell's help he transfigures a hole in the
wall, and transfigures a rocket which he straps to his broomstick, and out they
fly.  The rocket goes so fast the aurors can't keep up.

Its a decent bit of action in a story desperately needing a bit of action, but
its marred by excessive verbosity.  We have huge expanses of Hariezer talking
with Quirrell, Hariezer talking to himself, Hariezer thinking about dementors,
etc.  Instead of a tense, taught 50 pages we get a turgid 300.

After they get to safety, Quirrell and Hariezer discuss the horror that is
Azkaban.  Quirrell tells Hariezer that only a democracy could produce such a
torturous prison.  A dark lord like Voldemort would have no use for it once got
bored:

  > You know, Mr. Potter, if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named had come to rule over
  > magical Britain, and built such a place as Azkaban, he would have built it
  > because he enjoyed seeing his enemies suffer. And if instead he began to
  > find their suffering distasteful, why, he would order Azkaban torn down the
  > next day.

Hariezer doesn't take up the pro-democracy side, and only time will tell if he
goes full-on reactionary like Quirrell by the end of our story.  By the end,
Hariezer is ruminating on the Milgram experiment, although I don't think its
really applicable to the horror of Azkaban (its not like the dementors are "just
following orders"- they live to kill).

Hariezer then uses his time turner to go back to right before the prison
breakout, the perfect alibi to the perfect crime.

Dumbledore and Mcgonagall suspect Hariezer played a part in the escape, because
of the use of the rocket.  They ask Hariezer to use his time turner to send a
message back in time (which he wouldn't be able to do it if he had already used
his turner to hide his crime).

Hariezer solves this through the time-turner-ex-machina of Quirrell knowing
someone else with a time turner, because when Yudkowsky can't solve a problem
with a time turner, he solves it with two time turners. one or two chapters in
the 50 I've read through.

### For those who have read HPMOR

Pretty much everyone who recommended this to me described it as "imagine if
Harry Potter were a scientist, and used the scientific method to explore magic!"

Why do people advertise the story like this?

### Chapter 64/65 Respite {#ch64-65}

Chapter 64 is again "omake" so I didn't read it.

Chapter 65 appears to be a pit-stop before another long block of chapters.
Hariezer is chaffing that he has been confined to Hogwarts in order to protect
him from the dark lord, so he and Quirrell are thinking of hiring a play-actor
to pretend to be Voldemort, so that Quirrell can vanquish him.

These were a brief respite between the huge 12- chapter block I just got through
and _another giant 12 chapter block._ Its looking like the science ideas are
slowing down in these long chapter blocks, as the focus shifts to action.
[youzicha][youzicha_tumblr] has suggested a lot of the rest will be Hariezer
cleverly "hacking" his way out of situations, like the rocket in the previous 12
chapter block.  The sweet spot for me has been discussing the science presented
in these chapters, so between the expected lack of science and the increasing
length of chapter blocks, expect slower updates.

### Have you given up on HPMOR? No update in awhile?

You can rest easy, I'll get there eventually.  The chapters have grown in length
and I've been bored of the story for awhile, so its taking more resolve to dig
in.

### Scotched and Loaded

Time to start reading some HPMOR.  Hopefully updates tomorrow.

### Chapter 66-77 Absolutely, appallingly awful {#ch66-77}

There is a general problem with fanfiction (although usually not in serial
fiction where things tend to stay a bit more focused for whatever reason), where
the side/B-plots are written entirely in one pass instead of intertwined along
side the main plot.  Instead of being a pleasant diversion, the side-plot piles
up in one big chunk.  This is one such side-plot.

Also worth noting these chapters combine basically everything I dislike about
HPMOR into one book-length bundle of horror.  It was honest-to-god work to
continue to power through this section.  So this will be just a sketch of this
awful block of chapters.

We opened with another superfluous round of the army game, in which nothing
notable really happens other than some character named Daphne challenges Neville
to "a most ancient duel" WHICH IS APPARENTLY A BATTLE WITH LIGHTSABERS.  My eyes
rolled so hard I almost had a migraine, and this was the first chapter of the
block.

After the battle, Hermoine becomes concerned that women are underrepresented
among heros of the wizarding world, and starts a "Society for the Promotion of
Heroic Equality for Witches" or SPHEW.  They star with a protest in front of
Dumbledore's office and then decide to heroine it up and put an end to bullying.
You see, in the HPMOR world, bullying isn't a question of social dynamics, or
ostracizing kids.  Bullying is coordinated ambushes of kids in hallways by
groups of older kids, and an opportunity for "leveling-up."  The way to fight
bullies in this strange world is to engage in pitched wizard-battles in the
hallways (having fought an actual bully in reality as a middle schooler I can
tell you that at least for me "fight back" doesn't really solve the problem in
any way).  In this world, the victims of the bullying are barely mentioned and
don't have names.

And of course, _the authority figures like McGonagall don't even really show up
during all of this._  Students are _constantly_ attacking each other in the
hallways and no one is doing anything about it.  Because the way to make your
characters seem "rational" is to make sure the entire world is insane.

Things quickly escalate until 44 bullies get together to ambush the eight girls
in SPHEW.  A back of the envelope calculation suggests Hogwarts has maybe 300
students.  So we are to expect slightly more than 10% of the population of
students are the sort of "get together and plot an ambush" bullies that maybe
you find in 90s highschool TV shows.  Luckily, Hariezer had asked Quirrell to
protect the girls, so disguised Quirrell takes down the 44 bullies.

We get a "lesson" (lesson in this context means 'series of insanely terrible
ideas') on "heroic responsibility" in the form of Hariezer lecturing to
Harmoine .

  > The boy didn't blink. "You could call it heroic responsibility, maybe,"
  > Harry Potter said. "Not like the usual sort. It means that whatever happens,
  > no matter what, it's always your fault...  Following the school rules isn't
  > an excuse, someone else being in charge isn't an excuse, even trying your
  > best isn't an excuse. There just aren't any excuses, you've got toget the
  > job done no matter what."... Being a heroine means your job isn't finished
  > until you've done whatever it takes to protect the other girls,
  > permanently."

You know a good way to solve bullying?  Expel the bullies.  You know who has the
power to do that? McGonagall and Dumbledore.  A school is a system and has
procedures in place to deal with problems.  The proper response is almost always
"tell an authority figure you trust."  Being "rational" is knowing when to trust
the system to do its job.

In this case, Yudkowsky hasn't even pulled his usual trick of writing the system
as failing- no one even attempts to tell an authority figure about the bullying
and no authority figure engages with it, besides Quirrell who engages by
disguising himself and attacking students, and Snape who secretly (unknown even
to SPHEW) directs SPHEW to where the bullies will be.   The system of school
discipline stops existing for this entire series of chapters.

We get a final denouement between Hariezer and Dumbledore where the bullying
situation is discussed by referencce to Ghandi's passive resistance in India,
WW2 and Churchill, and the larger wizarding war that feel largely overwrought
because _it was bullying._  Big speeches about how Hermoine has been put in
danger, etc ring empty because _it was bullying._  Yes, being bullied is
traumatic (sometimes life-long traumatic), but its not WORLD WAR traumatic.

I also can't help but note the irony that the block's action largely started on
Hermoine's attempt to "self-actualize" by behaving more heroically, and ends
with Dumbledore and Hariezer discussing whether it was the doing the right thing
to _let Hermoine play her silly little game._

Terrible things in HPMOR

* Lack of science: I have no wrong science to complain about, because these
  chapters have no science references at all really.
* the world/characters behave in silly ways as a foil for the characters: the
  authority figures don't do anything to prevent the escalating
  bullying/conflict, aside from Snape and Quirrell who get actively involved.
  The bullying itself isn't an actual social dynamic, its just general
  "conflict" to throw at the characters.
* Time turner/invisibility cloak solves all problems: in a slight twist, Snape
  gives a time turner to a random student and uses her to pass messages to SPHEW
  so they can find and attack bullies
* Superfluous retreads of previous chapters: the army battle that starts its
  off, much of the bullying is retread.  There are several separate bully-fights
  in this block of chapters.
* Horrible pacing: this whole block of chapters is a B-plot roughly the length
  of an entire book.
* Stilted language.  Everyone refers to the magic light sabers as "the most
  ancient blade" every time they reference it

### Chekhov's Science

Anton Chekov once famously laid out a principal of minimalism in stage drama:

  > One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go
  > off. It's wrong to make promises you don't mean to keep

While this is perhaps a bit too minimalist (I don't think you need to remove
everything extraneous) I think the bit about promises is important.   You are
setting up your reader's expectations and developing the structure of your book.
Your developing the ideas and themes of the book.

If you spend the first 25ish chapters of your book having your main character
discuss his plan to use science to learn the secrets of magic and take over the
world, and attempting to recruit other characters to that effort, you are making
the reader lots of promises about what is to come in your fan fiction.  Dropping
these ideas completely for the next FIFTY FUCKING CHAPTERS is breaking all kinds
of promises to the reader.

### Munchkinism

I've been meaning make a post like this for several weeks, since
[yxoque][yxoque_tumblr] reminded me of the idea of the munchkin.
[jadagul][jadagul_tumblr] mentioned me in a post today that reminded me I had
never made it.  Anyway:

I grew up playing Dungeons and Dragons, which was always an extremely fun way to
waste a middle school afternoon.  The beauty of Dungeons and Dragons is that it
provides structure for a group of kids to sit around and tell a shared story as
a group.  The rules of the game are flexible, and one of the players acts as a
living rule-interpreter to guide the action and keep the story flowing.

Somehow, every Dungeons and Dragons community I've ever been part of (middle
school, highschool and college) had the same word for a particularly common
failure mode of the game, and that word was munchkin, or munchkining (does
anyone know if there was a gaming magazine that used this phrase?).  The failure
is simple - people get wrapped up in the letter of the rules, instead of the
spirit, and start building the most powerful character possible instead of a
character that makes sense as a role.  Instead of story flow, the game gets
bogged down in dice rolls and checks so that the munchkins can demonstrate how
powerful they are.  Particularly egregious munchkins have been known to cheat on
their character creation rolls to boost all their abilities.  With one
particular group in highschool, I witnessed one particularly hot-headed munchkin
yell at everyone else playing the game when the dungeon master (the human rule
interpreter) slightly modified a rule and ended up weakening the muchkin's
character.

The frustrating thing about HPMOR is that Hariezer is designed, as yxoque
pointed out, to be a munchkin- using science to exploit the rules of the magical
world (which could be an interesting question), but because Yudkowsky is writing
the rules of magic as he goes, Hariezer is essentially cheating at a game he is
making up on the fly.

All of the _cleverness_ isn't really cleverness- its easy to find loopholes in
the rules you yourself create as you go _especially if you created them to have
giant loopholes._

In Azkaban, Hariezer uses science to escape by transfiguring himself a rocket.
This only makes sense because for some unknown reason _magic brooms aren't as
fast as rockets._

In one of his army games, Hariezer uses gloves with gecko setae to climb down a
wall, because _for some reason broomsticks aren't allowed.  For some reason,
there is no 'grip a wall' spell._

Yudkowsky isn't bound by the handful of constraints in Rowling's world (where
Dementors represent depression, not death), hell _he doesn't even stick to his
own constraints.  In Hariezer's escape from Azkaban he violates literally the
only constraint he had laid down (don't transfigure objects into something you
plan to burn)._

Every other problem in the story is solved by using the time turner as a deus ex
machina.  Even when plot constraints mean Hariezer's time turner can't be used,
Yudkowsky just introduces another time turner rather than come up with a novel
and clever solution for his characters.

Hariezer's plans in HPMOR work only because the other characters become
temporarily dumb to accommodate his "rationality" and because the magic is
written around the idea of him succeeding.

### Munchkinism

[jadagul][jadagul_munchkinism_so_i_want_to]:

I think your argument shifted a bit.  Originally, you said what you wanted of a
good story is to see clever characters behaving cleverly (paraphrasing).

I was pointing out that this isn't what HPMOR actually is-  instead the world is
written insane to make the main characters look clever.

Even worse, there is no system to the magic at all, no rules have been set
forth, so its not even clever munchkining (for clever munchkining, you'd need a
clear set of rules to be exploited.  Instead we have been given only a few
rules, for instance- don't transfigure things if you plan to burn or eat them,
don't transfigure into a liquid or gas, and the only munchkining thats happened
so far involved violating that one rule).

Even the constraints Yudkowsky put on time turners are roundly ignored- when
Hariezer has already used his time turner but need another use, the plot pulls a
time-turner-ex-machina, and provides another student with a time turner as a
workaround.

What I was expecting in the story was Hariezer using science to systematically
study the rules of magic.  Once the rules were discovered, Hariezer could make
great discoveries, or munchkin his way to power and control.  But because no
system has been laid out, the munchkining is just cheap and easy, because the
rules are made up on the fly.

### Anonymous: I think the biggest ...

  > I think the biggest problem with HPMOR is that HJPEV thinks too quickly and
  > too accurately for an 11 year old child. What do you think?

I disagree strongly.  I think Hariezer's thinking and plotting are a lot like
Sherlock Holmes's deductions- he consistently takes actions that would result in
nothing but tears in reality, but the magic of the plot bends the world around
him to conform to his plan.  In reality you can't deduce someone's wife left him
by the fact that this tie doesn't match his shoes

I think the narrative is constructed in such a way that Hariezer spends 25
chapters or so dumping science jargon in every direction, which hooks the "I
fucking love science" crowd, and sets him up as a guru.

Having established his guru-ness, the ridiculousness begins in earnest, but by
now many readers already _knows_ Hariezer is a guru, so they don't stop to really
think about the implications of his plans, or notice that the plan succeeded
only because all the other characters have gone stupid.

### If HPMOR is so terrible, what would you consider good fiction?

Ghostbusters

### Are there HPMOR hateblogs?

In a [recent SlateStarCodex post][ssc_november_links],
[slatestarscratchpad][slatestarscratchpad_tumblr] mentioned 'hate-blogs' re:
HPMOR:

  > My personal go-to example would be that as soon as HPMOR became popular, it
  > inspired all of these hate blogs and hate forums attacking it and Eliezer
  > personally under the guise of "righting the wrong" of it being more
  > successful than it "deserved".

... do these actually exist anywhere?  When I first thought about starting this
project, I spent some time looking, and couldn't find anything that covered more
than the first chapter or two.  Did my google skills fail me?

### HPMOR Dislike

A few people responded to my call for HPMOR hate blogs, and I'm proud (a word
used here to mean "slightly horrified") to say I seem to be the only person to
have put a considerable amount of effort into not liking HPMOR.

A forum called Dark Lord Potter, which appears to be about Harry Potter fan
fiction has a thread full of short mixed reviews, and there are two other
abortive attempts at critique (just comments on one or two chapters).

So you no longer need to worry this is, in fact, bleeding edge criticism.

### "Genre Savvy"

So a lot of people have asked me to take a look at the Yudkowsky writing guide,
and I will eventually (first I have to finish HPMOR ,which is taking forever
because I'm incredibly bored with it, but I HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT- hopefully
more HPMOR live blogging after Thanksgiving).

But I did hit something that also applies to HPMOR, and a lot of other stories.
Yudkowsky advocated that characters "have read the books you've read" so they
can solve those problems.  One of my anonymous asked used the phrase "genre
savvy" for this- and google lead me to TV tropes page.   The problem with this
idea is that as soon as you insert a genre savvy character, your themes shift,
much like having a character break the fourth wall.  Suddenly your story is
_about_ stories. Your story is now _a commentary on the genre/genre
conventions._

Now, there are places where this can work fairly well- those Scream movies, for
instance, were supposed to (at least in part) ABOUT horror movies as much as
they WERE horror movies.  Similarly, every fan-fiction is (on some level) a
commentary on the original works, so "genre savvy" fan fiction self-inserts
aren't nearly as bad an idea as they could be.

HOWEVER (and this is really important)- MOST STORIES SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT STORIES
IN THE ABSTRACT/GENRE/GENRE CONVENTIONS, and this means it is a terrible idea
having characters that constantly approach things on a meta level "this is like
in this fiction book I read" .  If you don't have anything interesting to say
about the actual genre conventions, then adding a genre savvy character is
almost certainly going to do you more harm then good.  If you are bored with a
genre convention, you'll almost certainly get more leverage out of subverting it
(if you lead both the character AND the reader to expect a zig, and instead they
get a zag it can liven things up a bit) then by sticking in a genre-savvy
character.

Sticking in a genre-savvy character just says "look at this silly convention!"
and then when that convention is used anyway, it just feels like the writer
being a lazy hipster.  Sure your reader might get a brief burst of smugness
"he/she's right, all those genre books ARE stupid! Look how smart I am!" but you
aren't really moving your story forward.  You are critiquing lazy conventions
while also trying to use them.

If you don't like the conventions of a genre, don't write in that genre, or
subvert them to make things more interesting.  Or simply refuse to use those
conventions all together, go your own way.

### Anonymous: I've noticed that you ...

  > I've noticed that you complain several times that "Even when plot
  > constraints mean Hariezer's time turner can't be used, Yudkowsky just
  > introduces another time turner rather than come up with a novel and clever
  > solution for his characters." Well ... this was actually foreshadowed
  > repeatedly. Maybe you just didn't pick up on it?

First, foreshadowing that you (as an author) are going to solve a small conflict
the exact same way you've solved dozens of other small conflicts in the story
doesn't automatically make it interesting.  There is a sense that you could say
the first time he solves a problem with the time turner foreshadows the other
thousand times, but its boring to use the same exact mechanic over and over.

Next, there is some foreshadowing that everybody powerful/important has a time
turner (Hariezer thinks things along the line of 'everybody is probably living
30 hours,' etc.) but thats not actually what I was referring to there- after the
Azkaban escapade McGonnagall tries to test Potter by having him take a message
back in time.

For this to work as an actual problem in the story, McGonagall and the reader
both have to expect that having exhausted his time turner already, Hariezer will
be in trouble.  In a world where everyone has a time turner, this isn't even a
real test.  So having set up that expectation, we are then told Quirrell told
Hariezer of some slytherin student (Margaret Bulstrode) who has a time turner,
and we are also introduced to the "slytherin mail" concept.  Margaret/slytherin
notes were ushered into existence by Yudkowsky entirely to have a time turner to
fix this single problem for Hariezer.  This is what I mean by another time
turner is introduced.  The time turners we already know about can't work here
(he can't go to Dumbledore or Quirrell and use the fact that he deduced they had
a time turner to solve this problem), so out of thin air, we get this random
student with one.

Another Bulstrode shows up in the self-actualization chapters, and she is always
knows about events with the bullies that are going to happen- it would have been
interesting to have had that section of chapters first, and then have Hariezer
deduce that Bulstrode had the time turner.  Then at least he did something to
solve his problem

which painted to me the picture of someone who had been brainwashed, etc.  I
didn't think she was secretly good, but that she was manipulated.

When Hariezer meets her, she is still very clearly absolutely devoted to
Voldemort, which should have (I would think) prompted a bit of reflection on the
wisdom of helping an insane follower of Voldemort escape (to be totally fair, he
does have this moment, but it is AFTER the actual escape).

I normally don't let praise through on asks, because it sets off my narcissist
warning system.  But I'm making an exception because I've been in a bit of a
slump of the form "IS THIS INTERESTING? IS THERE A HUGE COMMUNITY OUT THERE THAT
IS HATING ALL OVER HPMOR?  I THOUGHT I WAS ALONE IN THIS. AM I JUST WASTING MY
TIME SAYING THINGS PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW?" that has been making it hard to read
(and write about) more of the fanfic.

Hopefully this pushes me over that hump.

### Chapter 78- Action Without Consequences {#ch78}

A change of tactics- this is chapter is part of another block of chapters, but
I'm having trouble getting through it, so I'm going to write in installments
chapter by chapter, instead of a dump on a 12 chapter block again.

This chapter is another installment of Quirrell's battle game.  This time, the
parents are in the stands, which becomes important when Hermione out-magics
Draco.

Afterwards, Draco is upset because his father saw him getting out magiced by a
mud blood.  This causes Draco, in an effort to save face or get revenge or
something, to send a note to lure Hermione to meet him alone.  Then, cut to the
next morning- Hermione is arrested for the attempted murder of Draco.   So thats
it for the chapter summary.

But I want to use this chapter to touch on something that has bothered me about
this story- most of the action is totally without stakes or consequences for the
characters.  As readers we don't care what happens.  In the case for the
Quirrell battle game,  the prize for victory was already handed out at the
Christmas break, none of the characters have anything on the line, and the story
doesn't really act like winning or losing has real consequences for anyone
involved.  A lot is happening, but its ultimately boring.

The same thing happened in the anti-bullying chapters.  Most of the characters
being victimized lack names or personalities.  Hermione and team aren't
defending characters we care about and like, they are fighting the abstract
concept of bullying (and the same is largely true of Hariezer's forays into
fighting bullies.)

Part of this is because of the obvious homage to Ender's game, without
understanding Ender's game was doing something very different- the whole point
of Ender's Game is that the series of games absolutely do feel low stakes.  Even
when Ender kills another kid, its largely shrugged off as Ender continuing to
win (which is the first sign something a bit deeper is happening).  It supposed
to feel game-y so the reader rides along with Ender and doesn't viscerally
notice the genocide happening.  The contrast between the real world stakes and
the games being played is the point of the story.  Where Ender's game failed for
me is _after_ the battles- we don't feel Ender's horror at learning what
happened. Sure Ender becomes speaker for the dead, but the book doesn't make us
feel Ender's horror the same way we ride along with the game stuff.  I think
this is why so many people I know largely missed the point of the book and
walked away with "War games are awesome!"  (SCROLL DOWN FOR Fight Club FOOTNOTE
THAT WAS MAKING THIS PARAGRAPH TOO LONG) But I digress- if your theme isn't
something to do with the the connection between war and games and the way people
perceive violence vs games, etc, turning down the emotional stakes and the
consequences for the characters make your story feel like reading a video game
play-by-play, which is horribly boring.

If you cut out all the Quirell game chapters after chapter 35, no one would
notice- there is nothing at stake.

ALSO- this chapter has an example of what I'll call "DM munchkining" i.e. its
easy to Munchkin when you write the rules.  Hariezer is looking for powerful
magic to aid him in battle, and starts reading up on potion making.  He needs a
way to make potions in the woods without magical ingredients, so he deduces by
reading books that _you don't really need a magical ingredient, you get out from
a potion ingredient what went in to making it._  So Hariezer makes a potion with
acorns that gets back all the light that went in to creating the acorn via
photosynthesis.  My point here is that _this rule was created in this chapter
entirely to be exploited by Hariezer in this battle._  In a previous battle
chapter, Hariezer exploits the fact that metal armor can block spells, a rule
created specifically for that chapter to be exploited.  _Its not munchkining,
its calvinball._

_FOOTNOTE:_ This same problem happens with Fight Club.  The tone of the movie
builds up Tyler Durden as this awesome dude and the tone doesn't shift when Ed
Norton's narrator character starts to realize how fucked everything is.  So you
end up with this movie thats suppose to be satirical but no one notices.  They
rebel against a society they find dehumanizing, BY CREATING A SOCIETY WHERE THEY
LITERALLY HAVE NO NAMES, but the tone is strong enough that people are like "GO

This is a large part of why I dislike even the science bits in HPMOR.  Things
like- the "Interdict of Merlin" which prevents powerful spells from being
written down, in the latest chapter I read it turns out the rules for making
potions aren't written down or shared, and Hariezer starts his scientific
investigations with Draco as a secretive conspiracy (to make sure the wrong
people don't get the knowledge ostensibly), all of these fit the Jekyll,
Frankenstein, we-don't-share-ideas-we-hide-them-because-they-are-dangerous-mold.

This "ideas are too dangerous to let out" goes against the culture of science
and prevents others from building off your ideas, which is SO important to
science.

Its possible Yudkowsky will surprise me, and it will turn out that the reason
powerful magic is dying out is the secretive culture or something, but given how
positively these ideas are discussed in the story I doubt it.

### Anonymous: the secretive culture ...

When does he actually establish this theory?   Have I not gotten there yet?  I
admit to reading less closely as time goes on.

In the story, so far Quirrell discusses secret science like this:

  > There are gates you do not open, there are seals you do not breach! The
  > fools who can't resist meddling are killed by the lesser perils early on,
  > and the survivors all know that there are secrets you do not share with

Harry like this:

  > with. It had never occurred to him that nuclear physicists should have
  > formed a conspiracy of silence to keep the secret of nuclear weapons from
  > anyone not smart enough to be a nuclear physicist

Harry also says this to Draco when starting his magi-science efforts:

  > As you say, we will establish our own Science, a magical Science, and that
  > Science will have smarter traditions from the very start." The voice grew
  > hard. "The knowledge I share with you will be taught alongside the
  > disciplines of accepting truth, the level of this knowledge will be keyed to
  > your progress in those disciplines, and you will share that knowledge with
  > no one else who has not learned those disciplines. Do you accept this?

i.e. secret science is smarter science.

These are the ideas Harry thinks of for why magic is fading:

  > 1. Magic itself is fading.
  > 2. Wizards are interbreeding with Muggles and Squibs.
  > 3. Knowledge to cast powerful spells is being lost.
  > 4. Wizards are eating the wrong foods as children, or something else besides
  >    blood is making them grow up weaker.
  > 5. Muggle technology is interfering with magic. (Since 800 years ago?)
  > 6. Stronger wizards are having fewer children. (Draco = only child? Check if
  >    3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, had any children.)

And I don't think we've been back to these ideas about magic fading away since
then.  Also, he speaks positively about restricting dangerous knowledge in lots
of places throughout the story (i.e. keeping young wizards from casting spells).

And then the magic fading away plot-thread goes away and stops coming back.

### Anonymous: I notice two ...

Yes, but remember in the context of the story, those arguments gets tested and
rejected.  HPMOR is a lot of things, but it doesn't go down that road.

### A family member...

stumbled upon this tumblr/blog, and didn't realize HPMOR was a real story.  They
instead thought this blog was mostly some sort of bizarre performance piece.

### HPMOR blog coming soon

I know most of you come for the HPMOR blogging, you'll be pleased to know I read
a few more chapters during holiday travel.  I'll be updating more after I catch
up on some work.

### Anonymous: Can you do FIO ...

  > Can you do FIO after you finish HPMOR?

Probably not.  Finishing HPMOR has been proving to be quite a chore

### HPMOR chapter 79 {#ch79}

This chapter continues on from 78.  Hermione has been arrested for murder, but
Hariezer now realizes in a sudden insight that she has given a false memory.

Hariezer also realizes this is how the Weasley twins planted Rita Skeeter's
false news story- they simply memory charmed Rita.  Of course, this opens up
more questions then it solves- if false memory charming can be done with such
precision, wouldn't there be a rash of manipulations of this type?  Its such an
obvious manipulation technique that chapters 24-26 with the Fred and George
"caper" was written in a weirdly non-linear style to try to make it seem more
mysterious.

Anyway, Hariezer tells the adults who start investigating who might have memory
charmed Hermione (you'd think wizard police would do some sort of investigation
but its HPMOR, so the world needs to be maximally silly as a foil to Hariezer).

And then he has a discussion with the other kids who are bad mouthing Hermione:

  > Professor Quirrell isn't here to explain to me how stupid people are, but I
  > bet this time I can get it on my own. People do something dumb and get
  > caught and are given Veritaserum. Not romantic master criminals, because
  > they wouldn't get caught, they would have learned Occlumency. Sad, pathetic,
  > incompetent criminals get caught, and confess under Veritaserum, and they're

  > Right? So your brain, by sheer Pavlovian association, links the idea of

  > the hypothesis into a bucket of things you don't believe, and you're done.
  > Just like my father thought that magical hypotheses could never be believed,
  > because he'd heard so many stupid people talking about magic. Believing a
  > hypothesis that involves False Memory Charms is low-status.

This sort of thing bothers the hell out me.  Not only is cloying elitism
creeping in, but in HPMOR as in the real world, arguments regarding "status" are
just thinly disguised ad-hominems.  True or not true, they aren't really
attacking an argument, just the people making them.

After all, if we fall back on the "Bayesian conspiracy" confessing to a
crime/having a memory of a crime is equal evidence for having done the crime and
having been false memory charmed, so all the action here is in the prior.
CLAIMING a false memory charm is evidence of nothing at all.

So, if the base rate of false memory charms is so low that its laughable and
"low status," then the students are correctly using Bayesian reasoning.

Although Hariezer may point out that they aren't taking into account evidence
about what sort of person Hermione is, but if the base rates of false memory
charms are really so low that is unlikely to matter much- after all Hariezer
doesn't have any specific positive evidence she was false memory charmed, and
she has been behaving strangely toward Draco for awhile (which Hariezer suggests
is a symptom of the way the perpetrator went about the false memory charm, but
could just as easily be evidence she did it- the action is still in the prior).

Similarly, his father didn't believe in magic because it SHOULDN'T have been
believed- until the story begins he has supposedly lived his whole life in our
world- where magic is quite obviously not a real thing, regardless of "status. "

OF COURSE- if the world were written as a non-silly place, the base rate for
false memory charms would be through the roof and everyone would say "yea, she
was probably false memory charmed! Who just blurts out a confession?" and the
wizard cops would just do their job.

### HPMOR remember when

Way back in chapter 20 something, Quirrell gave Hariezer Roger Bacon's magic
diary, and it was going to jump start his investigation of the rules of magic?
And then it was literally never mentioned again?  The aptly named Checkov's
Roger Bacon's Magi-science Diary probably applies here.

First, I wouldn't phrase it as "leveling up."  Life isn't really like a video
game, in my experience.

In my case, the answer to how I know most of what I know is probably a liberal
arts education.  I started my academic career as an english major (but got bored
after a three semesters and switched to physics), so I bounced around through a
wide variety of classes.  Basically, ask lots of questions, read a lot,etc.
Standard stuff really.

### HPMOR Chapter 80 {#ch80}

Apparently in the wizarding world, the way a trial is conducted involves a bunch
of politicians voting if someone is guilty or innocent, so in this chapter the
elder Malfoy uses his influence to convict Hermione.  Not much to this chapter
really.

BUT in some asides, we do get some flirting with neoreaction:

  > At that podium stands an old man, with care-lined face and a silver beard
  > that stretches down below his waist; this is Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
  > Dumbledore... Karen Dutton bequeathed the Line to Albus Dumbledore... each
  > wizard passing it to their chosen successor, back and back in unbroken chain

  > of Merlin's sacrifice, the most important duty of any Chief Warlock has been
  > to exercise the highest caution in their choice of people who are both good
  > and able to discern good successors.

And we get the PC/NPC distinction used by Hariezer to separate himself from the
sheeple:

The wealthy elites of magical Britain have collective force, but not individual
agency; their goals are too alien and trivial for them to have personal roles in
the tale. As of now, this present time, the boy neither likes nor dislikes the
plum-colored robes, because his brain does not assign them enough agenthood to
be the subjects of moral judgment. He is a PC, and they are wallpaper.

Hermione is convicted and Hariezer is sad he couldn't figure out something to do
about it (he did try to threaten the elder Malfoy to no avail).

### HPMOR Chapter 81 {#ch81}

Our last chapter ended with Hermione in peril- she was found guilty of the
attempted murder of Draco!  How will Hariezer get around this one?

Luckily the way the wizard world justice system works is fucking insane- being
found guilty puts Hermione in the Malfoy's "blood debt."  So Hariezer tells
Malfoy:

  > By the debt owed from House Malfoy to House Potter!...I'm surprised you've
  > forgotten...surely it was a cruel and painful period of your life, laboring
  > under the Imperius curse of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, until you were freed
  > of it by the efforts of House Potter. By my mother, Lily Potter, who died
  > for it, and by my father, James Potter, who died for it, and by me, of
  > course.

So Hariezer wants the blood debt transferred to him so he can decide Hermione's
fate (what a convenient and ridiculous way to handle a system of law and order).

But blood debts don't transfer in this stupid world, instead you also have to
pay money. So Malfoy demands something like twice the money in Hariezer's vault.
Hariezer waffles a bit, but decides to pay.  Because the demand is such a large
sum, this will involve going into debt to the Malfoys.

And then things get really stupid- Dumbledore says, as guardian of Hariezer's
vault he won't let the transaction happen.

  > I'm - sorry, Harry - but this choice is not yours - for I am still the
  > guardian of your vault."
  >
  > "What? " said Harry, too shocked to compose his reply.
  >
  > "I cannot let you go into debt to Lucius Malfoy, Harry! I cannot! You do not
  > know - you do not realize -"

So... here is a question- if Hariezer is going to go into a lot of debt to pay
Malfoy how does blocking him access to his money help avoid the debt?  Wouldn't
Hariezer just take out a bigger loan from Malfoy?

Anyway, despite super rationality, Hariezer doesn't think through how stupid
Dumbledore's threat is.  Hariezer instead threatens to destroy Azkaban if
Dumbledore won't let him pay Malfoy, so Dumbledore relents.

Malfoy tries to weasel out of this nebulous blood debt arrangement because the
rules of wizard justice change on the fly, but Hermione swears allegiance to
House Potter and that prevents Malfoy's weasel attempt.

  > I acknowledge the debt, but the law does not strictly oblige me to accept it
  > in cancellation," said Lord Malfoy with a grim smile. "The girl is no part
  > of House Potter; the debt I owe House Potter is no debt to her...
  >
  > And Hermione, without waiting for any further instructions, said, the words
  > spilling out of her in a rush, "I swear service to the House of Potter, to
  > obey its Master or Mistress, and stand at their right hand, and fight at
  > their command, and follow where they go, until the day I die."

The implications here are obvious- if you saved all of magical britain from a
dark lord, and _literally everyone owes you a "blood debt"_ you are totally
above the law.  Hariezer should just steal the money he owes Malfoy from some
other magical families.

### Anonymous: No one cares ...

  > No one cares what you think of HPMOR. Maybe when it wins a hugo you'll STFU.

Serious question- does anyone really think HPMOR could win a hugo?  I don't
actually follow hugo awards and have no idea how they work.

Is there a category for fan fiction? Or does setting your book in someone else's
world already disqualify you?  Does your book have to be actually published?

You don't have to?  I've been as explicit as I can about my criticisms, you can
read them and agree or disagree.

Also, a post-diction: I predict that Brin, and maybe some other endorsements,
rolled in during the fanfiction's early days when it seemed like it was going to
be a somewhat humorous fiction where Hariezer used the scientific method to
investigate magic.  All those promises to the reader in the set up have been
broken completely, and it has become something very different.

I attempted to test my post-diction, but then I remembered that I was bored with
this.

I don't know much about the hugo award.  I've read maybe a few books that have
said "hugo award winner" or the like on the cover.  The two that come to mind
are Dune and Ender's Game.  I don't know anything else about it, maybe some
really horrid schlock wins, since it seems to be up to a vote of convention
attendees, which seems somewhat gameable.

That said, I don't think HPMOR really "feels" like a book.  It probably could
with some serious editing (you could probably cut its length at least in half,
and removing all the unfired chekhov's guns,etc), but right now it feels like a
first-draft of something.  Professional editing is a thing for a very good
reason.

### HPMOR Chapter 82 {#ch82}

So the trial is wrapped up, but to finish off the section we get a long
discussion between Dumbledore and Hariezer.

First, credit where credit is due there is an atypical subversion here- now its
Dumbledore attempting to give a rationality lesson to Hariezer, and Hariezer
agrees that he is right.  Its an attempt to mix up the formula a bit, and I
appreciate it even if the rest of this chapter is _profoundly_ stupid.

So what is the rationality lesson here?

  > "Yes," Harry said, "I flinched away from the pain of losing all the money in
  > my vault. But Idid it! That's what counts! And you -" The indignation that
  > had faltered out of Harry's voice returned. "You actually put a price on

  >

  >
  > Now you're just talking mathematical nonsense, said Slytherin. Ravenclaw,
  > back me up here?
  >
  > "Is Minerva's life also of infinite worth?" the old wizard said harshly.
  > "Would you sacrifice Minerva to save Hermione?"
  >
  > "Yes and yes," Harry snapped. "That's part of Professor McGonagall's job and
  > she knows it."
  >
  > "Then Minerva's value is not infinite," said the old wizard, "for all that
  > she is loved. There can only be one king upon a chessboard, Harry Potter,
  > only one piece that you will sacrifice any other piece to save. And Hermione
  > Granger is not that piece. Make no mistake, Harry Potter, this day you may
  > well have lost your war."

Basically, the lesson is this- you have to be willing to put a value on human
life, even if it seems profane.  Its actually a good lesson and very important
to learn.  If everyone was more familiar with this, the semi frequent GOVERNMENT
HEALTHCARE IS DEATH PANELS panic would never happen.  Although I'd add a caveat-
anyone who has worked in healthcare does this so often that we start to make a
mistake the other way (forgetting that underneath the numbers are actual
people).

Anyway, to justify the rationality lesson further we get a reference to some of
Tetlock's work (note: I'm unfamiliar with the work cited here, so I'm taking
Yudkowsky at his word- if you've read the rest of my hpmor stuff, you know this
is dangerous).

  > You'd already read about Philip Tetlock's experiments on people asked to
  > trade off a sacred value against a secular one, like a hospital
  > administrator who has to choose between spending a million dollars on a

  > the hospital going bankrupt the next day?

To bring it home, we find out that Voldemort captured Dumbledore's brother and
demanded ransom, and Mad Eye counseled thusly

  > "You ransom Aberforth, you lose the war," the man said sharply. "That
  > simple. One hundred thousand Galleons is nearly all we've got in the
  > war-chest, and if you use it like this, it won't be refilled. What'll you

  > demand. Alice, Minerva, anyone you care about, they'll all be targets if you
  > pay off the Death Eaters. That's not the lesson you should be trying to
  > teach them."

So instead of ransoming Aberforth he burned Lucious Malfoy's wife alive (or at
least convinced the death eaters that he did).  That way they would think twice
about targeting him.

I think the rationality lesson is fine and dandy, just one problem- this
situation is not at _all like the hospital administrator in the example given._
The problem here is that the idea of putting a price on a human life is only a
useful concept in day-to-day reality where money has some real meaning.  In an
actual war, even one against a sort of weird guerrilla army of dark wizards
money only becomes useful if you can exchange it for more resources, and in the
wizard war resources means wizards.

Ask yourself this- would a death eater target someone close to Dumbledore even
if _there was no possibility of ransom?_  OF COURSE THEY WOULD- the whole point is
defeating Dumbledore, the person standing against them.  Voldemort wouldn't ask
for ransom, because its a stupid thing to do- he would kill Aberforth and send
pieces of him to Dumbledore by owl.    This idea that ransoming makes targets of
all of Dumbledore's allies is just idiotic- they are already targets.

Next, ask yourself this- does Voldemort have any use for money?  Money is an
abstract, useful because we can exchange for useful things.  But its pretty
apparent that Voldemort doesn't really need money- he has no problem killing,
taking and stealing.  The parts of magical Britain that are willing to stand up
to him won't sell his death eaters goods at any price, and the rest are so
scared they'll give him anything for free.

Meanwhile, Dumbledore is leading a dedicated resistance- basically a volunteer
army.  He doesn't need to buy people's time, they are giving it freely!  Mad Eye
himself notes that he could ask the Longbottoms or the Potters to empty their
vaults _and they would._  What the resistance needs isn't money, its _people
willing to fight._  So in the context of this sort of war, and able fighting man
like Aberforth is worth basically infinite money- money is common and useless
and people willing to stand up to Voldemort are in extremely tight supply.

It would have made a lot more sense to have Voldemort ask for prisoner exchange
or something like that.  Aberforth in exchange for Bellatrix Black.  Then both
sides would be trading value for value.  But then the Tetlock reference wouldn't
be nearly as on-the-nose.

At least this chapter makes clear the reason for the profoundly stupid wizard
justice system and the utterly absurd blood-debt-punishment system.  The whole
idea was to arrange things so Hariezer could be asked to pay a ransom to
Luscious Malfoy, so the reader can learn about Tetlock's research/putting a
price on lives,etc.

At least I only have like 20 chapters of this thing left.

### Anonymous: "At least I only have ...

I guess I'm sort of implicitly assuming it will go the way of the rationality

Eh, I don't want to read the notes, I have enough to read without them.

But I refuse to believe despite what may be claimed that the plot was outlined
that far in advance- there is simply too much stuff that inadvertently fell away
(literally all the scientific exploration stopped 70 or 80 chapters ago.
Bacon's magic diary thing has never been brought up again...)

Maybe?  But George Lucas claimed to have written all the star wars movies in
advance, but Leia kissed Luke...

An anon wrote to tell me that earlier chapters referenced Malfoy's mother,
before that was re-written (after it was decided she'd been burned alive I
guess?)  No idea if that is accurate, but it would point in my favor if true.
What events do you consider to have been set up dozens of chapters in advance?

And I'm not complaining about loose ends- I'm complaining that the direction the
plot started in was completely abandoned around chapter 25- all the "use science
to master magic" stuff _stopped._  The sort of stuff you usually notice in an
outline.  Mininally, its an unlikely pacing problem.  Plot threads running for
25 chapters, and then being dropped for ~80ish chapters, only to be picked back
up again.

### HPMOR bitching

Much like my previous name of the wind complaints, HPMOR is heavy with
exposition- and for a similar reason.  Hariezer is too "awesome" which leads to
heavy-handed exposition (if for slightly different reasons than name of the
wind).

The standard rule of show,don't tell implies that the best way to teach your
audience something in a narrative is to have your characters learn from
experience.  Your characters need to make a mistake, or have something backfire.
That way they can come out the other side stronger, having learned something.
If you don't trust your audience to have gotten the lesson, you can cap it off
with some exposition outlining exactly what you want to learn, but the core of
the lesson should be taught by the characters experience.

But Yudkowsky inserted a Hariezer fully-equipped with the "methods of
rationality."  So we get lots of episodes that set-up a conflict, and then
Hariezer has a huge dump of exposition that explains why its not really a
problem because rationality-judo, and the tension drains away.  It would be far
better to have Hariezer learn over time, so the audience can learn along with
him.

So Hariezer isn't going to grow, he is just going to exposition dump most of his
problems away.  We can at least watch him explore the world, right?   After all,
Yudkowsky has put a "real scientist" into Hogwarts so we can finally see what
material you actually learn at wizard school!  All that academic stuff missing
from the original novels!  NOPE- we haven't had a single class in the last 60
chapters.  Hariezer isn't even learning magic in a systematic way.

I really, really don't see what people see in this.  The handful of chapters I
found amusing feel like an eternity ago, it ran off the rails dozens of chapters
ago!  People sell the story as "using the scientific method in JK Rowling's
universe" but a more accurate description would be "it starts as using the
scientific method in JK rowling's universe, but stops doing that around chapter
25 or so.  Then mostly its just about a war game, with some political
maneuvering."

(I'm assuming these asks are from the same person).

First, Hariezer does _not_ make mistakes that the story _treats_ like mistakes.
A real mistake has long term consequences and sets events in motion.  The
character learns something when he lives through a real mistake.  What has
Hariezer _learned_ in a character-defining way in the first 80 chapters of
HPMOR? Nothing.

When Draco hits Hariezer with a torture spell, its part of Hariezer's conversion
attempt- and Hariezer escapes via time turner.

The "time turner fiasco" you refer to is literally _Hariezer using the time
turner to solve his problems too much._  The punishment is having the time
turner restricted to only evening use- _HOWEVER this doesn't stop the time
turner from continuing to be used to solve almost every problem._  No long term
consequences what so ever.

Hariezer hasn't "lost hard" in 80 chapters of HPMOR, let alone in the first 10!
(I think he has just been sorted by chapter 10).

I'm not saying a book _has_ to be driven by character development- plenty of great
books barely have any.  But when the goal is explicitly to teach to the
audience, the best way is to have the audience learn along with the characters.

And if your story isn't going to be character driven, it would be nice to have
the story be narrative driven, but most of the episodes in HPMOR do little to
further any overall plot.

Second, popularity isn't really a measure of quality.  Those Michael Bay
Transformers movies make money, and Dan Brown is a best selling author.  That
doesn't mean its wrong to like these things, merely that you should recognize
its a guilty pleasure.  Like eating candy or drinking soda.  I have my own
guilty pleasure books, but I don't confuse them for high art.

Third, no I haven't at all looked at EY's facebook page.  I clearly don't
understand facebook in this day and age.  As a crochety old man, in my day
facebook was used to share stuff friends?

Anyway, I dispute that there is any sort of HPMOR "hatedom."  After looking
around, I could only find one long thread on a fan fiction forum (Dark Lord
Potter), and its just a thread full of mixed reviews.  Other than that, there is
just me.  In the culture I was trained in (physics), if no one is criticizing
you, no one is taking you seriously.  Pretty much no one takes HPMOR seriously.

Usually superhero stories create drama by inserting problems that the hero can't
solve with their powers (Spiderman's interpersonal drama, for instance).  Or by
embedding the superhero in a more traditional narrative (the original Superman
movie is a pretty traditional love story, some Spiderman arcs are coming of age
stories,etc).

HPMOR is like a superman comic arc where supes talks with a senator for 5
issues, and then when he encounters a problem it turns out his laser eyes also
work as a 3d printer (in order to see powers used creatively, we have to know
what the rules are).  Also, it turns out that the president is chosen on the
basis of who can throw a car the farthest.

The structure of HPMOR- many chapters are just conversations of political
maneuvering and many problems are solved via calvinball (need to defeat
dementors? Turns out if you believe hard enough in transhumanism your patronus
can kill a dementor.  Need to escape a prison? Turns out rockets are faster than
broomsticks.  We get introduced to the idea that metal blocks certain spells in
a chapter where Hariezer uses it to win his war game.  The idea that potions
work by "what you put in" is introduced in the chapter where Hariezer uses it to
make his blinding light potion from acorns,etc.).

And the world itself is organized in really insane ways to make it easy for
Hariezer (like if in a superman comic it turned out the president was elected by
who can toss a car the farthest- its obviously set up so that only superman can
win).  Hermione convicted of murder? Luckily, the way the wizarding world
blood-debt system of justice is organized, Hariezer is literally above the law
(who won't owe a blood debt to the person who got rid of Voldemort?).

I do think maybe this is part of the issue?  Certainly I've mentioned before how
frustrating I find it that Hariezer is surprisingly incurious (when Dumbledore
tells a transhumanist Hariezer about a literal gateway to the Afterlife,
Hariezer asks no questsions, for instance).

I don't buy this theory, really.  But then again I've never lived in someone

### HPMOR Chapter 83-84 {#ch83-84}

These are just rehashes of things we've already been presented with (so many
words, so little content).  The other students still think Hermione did it
(although this is written in an akward tell rather than show style- Hariezer
_tells_ Hermione what is going on, rather than Hermione or the reader
experiencing it).  We get gems of cloying elitism like this:

There is one bit of new info- as part of this investigation of the attempted
murder of Draco, I guess Quirrell was investigated, and the aurors seem to think
he is some missing wizard lord or something.  This is totally superfluous, I
assume we all know Quirrell is Voldemort.  I'm hoping this doesn't turn into a
plot line.

And finally, Quirrell tries to convince Hermione to leave and go to a wizard
school where people don't think she tried to kill someone.  This is fine, but in
part of it, Quirrell gives us this gem on being a hero:

So... the people seem mostly to rally around Dumbledore.  He has a position of
power and influence because of his dark-wizard vanquishing deeds.  There aren't
a lot of indications people are actively attempting to make Dumbledore's life
unpleasant, he has the position he wants, turned down the position of minister
of magic,etc.  People are mostly in awe of Dumbledore.

But there is some other hero, we are supposed to believe, who society mocked?  I
can't help but draw parallels to Friendly AI research here...

Yes he is obviously talking about himself.  But no one's survival ever depended
on Voldemort, nor did he ever try to be the hero.  He is making up a story.

And my point was his story in no way jives with the in-world heroic experience
(which would be Dumbledore's)

I feel like I'm being to flippant with my criticism and as a result we are
talking past each other.  To be explicit

1. the rules of magic are either constructed specifically for Hariezer to be
   able to take advantage of them (thinking transhumanist thoughts hard enough
   kills dementors, thinking about one specific formulation of quantum mechanics
   hard enough lets you partially transifgure stuff), or are just made up on the
   spot (the broomstick/rocket thing, metal blocks spells).

There is no systematic set of rules, so all exploiting of the magic system is
because a rule was made up _specifically_ to be taken advantage of.  It doesn't
matter if the rule was introduced a chapter before it was needed, the rule
basically amounts to "you can't destroy a dementor unless you are Harry Potter."

2. The world is made up similarly.  The part of the "blood debt" that was
   established by Rita Skeeter's article is that in-world it was plausible for
   Ginny to betrothed to Harry because of a "blood debt"- but the state isn't
   really involved in marriage.  People can get married for whatever reasons
   they want.

However, its when we get to the trial that it gets out of hand-

_The part that is stupid is that the entire system of wizard justice works on
blood debts._

It doesn't matter that once we know the justice system works on blood debts we
can infer that Lucious has a blood debt to Harry from earlier in the story- its
obviously built to be exploited.  Wizard justice is constructed in such a way
that Harry Potter is above the law.  Think of the number of families that most
owe him a blood debt.

To go back to the stupid superman example, imagine if instead of making super
man super strong, the writers made everything in his universe out of balsa wood
(and no one else had ever though to try punching stuff).

### Anonymous: Why do you keep ...

  > Why do you keep saying HJPEV isn't curious? He is always talking about books
  > he has studied!

I think there is some tension in that the text tells us a few times that
Hariezer is curious.  But I don't think he acts curious, especially when
presented with new information.

As an example, consider the chapter where he argues against Dumbledore about
death.  When Dumbledore tells Hariezer about a literal doorway to the afterlife
kept in the ministry of magic basement, Hariezer just logic chops it into
submission like its a point in a debate.  A legitimately curious person, when
told about something like that would want to see it and study it, and would
maybe hold off on lecturing someone.

Hariezer doesn't really care about why magic works the way it does, or any of
that.  Hariezer cares about what he can do with more knowledge.

Now, to contrast, here are some anecdotes about real people I know who are super
curious.

My friend Phil is one of the more curious people I've met.  When he was in grade
school he read in a comic that Gambit of the X-men charged his playing cards
with kinetic energy and that's why they exploded.  So he started asking people
what kinetic energy was.  He couldn't get a good answer, so he went to the
encyclopedia britannica which directed him to physics books.  This lead to more
questions, etc.  He couldn't stop poking at that one question.  Years later, he
was in a physics phd program for more than a decade with enough course work for
masters degrees in 6 fields (that sadly, the university would not give to him).
Hell, for all I know he is STILL in grad school.

I have a similar story with the anti-matter reactor in Star Trek.  Trying to get
answers to questions that were raised by a TV show I watched in the late 80s has
shaped most of my life.  I have a bit more focus than Phil, so I at least
managed to finish grad school.

A group of people in my physics department "borrowed" a parking meter for a
weekend because we realized we didn't understand how the infrared meter auditing
worked.  A bbq I hosted in grad school turned into an entire weekend of
bbq-based experiment to figure out why temperatures plateau for so long when you
are smoking meat.  My office mate once set a trash can in the office on fire
trying to figure out if fire was a plasma.

### I snipped a bunch ...

I snipped a bunch here to focus on a few points.

[mugasofer][mugasofer_ah_yeah_sorry]:

  > I'm thinking. How many families had members who Voldemort was personally
  > forcing to kill people, or otherwise torturing? Like, five?

So we know specifically of the Malfoys and the Weasleys, from the story.  We can
infer every former death eater that isn't in wizard jail because they would have
claimed they were cursed just like Malfoy.

If bits of the original books still hold true, we also get the Longbottoms.  If
a blood debt is established by avenging a murder (as the original concept would
imply), we get almost all of the wizards who were fighting Voldemort, who would
probably have had family members murdered.

So its probably a lot of people, and mostly very powerful people from both sides
of the previous "war".  Which, in the small world of wizarding Britain will make
a person very much above much of the law.

Even a blood debt from particularly wealthy person would be enough to pay off
Malfoy, given that one blood debt was enough for Malfoy to get paid that much.

This is my point.  This is how the entire world feels to me- the world can be
arbitrarily silly to make Hariezer look smart.  So we agree somewhat.

No, this isn't established that you can't use rules to create your own spells.
It's established that _it could be dangerous_ to try to create your own spells,
but it's not impossible.  The fact that it could be dangerous implies its
possible.

What is frustrating is that Hariezer HASN'T spent much time actually using the
scientific method to investigate magic.  There is one chapter where Hariezer and
Hermione try to figure out some ideas about magic, but the experiments don't
work out, we the readers don't learn much.  Hariezer never tries again.

There is another section where Hariezer decides (without doing an experiment)
that if you focus really hard on one very specific formulation of quantum
mechanics that you'll be to partially transfigure....

And thats basically it for the rules of magic that we know.   Hariezer isn't
creating spells because he hasn't really tried to figure out the rules.

This is ok in the original books, because the focus was on adventure, and
childhood friendships,etc.  This is far less ok in HPMOR where the focus is
supposed to be on rationality and the scientific method.

The difference here is that no one thinks that Star Trek's technobabble is a
good aspect of the show.

Its a matter of focus, Star Trek is about the exploration and the characters.
Sure, lots of little details don't make a lot of sense, but the best episodes
breeze past those little details.  They don't matter to the story. In the worst
episodes, too much focus on those details kills the story.

In HPMOR, on the other hand, when the details don't make sense, Hariezer often
exploits that to his advantage.  To use the example you do- the wizard exchange
rate is a little detail that I complained about and moved past (you'll recall
from [my post on that
chapter](#chapter-4---in-which-for-the-first-time-i-wanted-the-author-to-take-things-further)
that it was the first chapter I actually found a bit interesting).  It doesn't
really matter to the overall story much. However, if Hariezer uses the exchange
rate arbitrage to pay back Malfoy, it'll put that detail into focus in a bad
way.

If the blood debt system were similar to the exchange rates, something more or
less in the background, it wouldn't be worth as much complaining as I've done.
However, Hariezer used it to resolve his issue, which puts the whole stupid
thing into focus.

So a few thoughts in somewhat random order.  Star Wars is a very arch typical
story.  Its not about its details, in some sense its comforting because its
familiar.  The fatal flaw in the Death Star isn't the exhaust port, really- its
the Empire's arrogance.  Its a typical scrappy-underdog find the weakness the
arrogant adversary neglected.  Tortoise and Hare stuff.

But if you inserted a Luke Skywalker who is constantly comparing what is
happening to a fantasy story, and using the force to build perpetual motion
machines, we would enter a different realm.  It would turn into a story at least
in part about genre, and genre convention.

I think that Yudkowsky is right in the sense that a story about genre convention
probably can work better in something like a fan fiction, for the reason that
setting your work in another's universe immediately sets the genre, and the
expectations of that genre.  But once you've chosen to write a story like that,
every new world building decision you make, and every change to the original
world, is going to be under a microscope because of the type of story you've
chosen to write.  After all, your story is explicitly and implicitly making a
commentary on the world building conventions.

To go back to Superman, who I have been using as the subject of many, many
terrible examples.  If I wrote a story where Superman, instead of fighting
crime, hops on a treadmill and generates cheap electricity 20 hours a day, and
clean, cheap energy transforms the world and eliminates crime, then its a sort
of winking nod to the idea that Superman comics aren't _really_ about exploring
the consequences of super powers, they are about the character relationships and
the power fantasy.

But if in the same story, I suggest kryptonite represents death, and Superman
defeats Lex Luther (who I guess in this story runs an oil company and is trying
to stop Superman's clean energy?) by thinking properly transhumanist thoughts,
then I've started to make a weird hash of things.  If I then insert a political
system where outcomes are determined by feats of strength, readers will say (or
at least they should say) "umm? What exactly are you doing here?"

Name of the Wind is especially odd because the character being amazing breaks
the narrative in all sorts of places.  In the framing story, characters will say
things to Kvothe like "wait... why didn't you do this obvious thing using your
mad skillz?"  "Well..."  Rothfuss could have eased these problems by simply not
making young Kvothe amazing out-of-the-box.

Also, with Kvothe, people just randomly recognize he is awesome with no real
reason, and give him stuff.  He walks into a shoe store barefoot and the shop
keeper gives him shoes because he likes the look of his feet.  This is a thing
that happens.

### To the anon or anons pelting me with asks

I do not think that I'm taking HPMOR too seriously, or that I should stop
thinking about it and just enjoy it.

HPMOR isn't described by people as a goofy, "shounen anime," adolescent power
fantasy.  People who recommended it to me described it using phrases like "best
thing I've ever read,"  "mind expanding," "incredibly important".

I've got no problem if you love it, you are free to love it.  But surely you
must recognize that there is a big difference between goofy shounen anime, or
adolescent power fantasy AND "best thing ever."

### What's better HPMOR or the canon books?

  > At least HPMOR is much better than the canon.

I find the original books orders of magnitude better than HPMOR.  I don't know
if you can tell from reading the live-blog-thingy of HPMOR that I've been doing,
but mostly I don't like it.

  > Your worst enemy is stranded on a desert island, which book do you give him,
  > Name of the Wind or HPMOR?

I'd probably give him Dune, with something witty written in the cover about his
lack of water/hydraulic despotism.

Or a collection of Coleridge poems, with the famous bit from Rime of the Ancient
Mariner highlighted

  >

underlined or bolded or something.

To get to what I think the question is asking, I find both books to be fairly
bad.

### Narrator as pressure release valve

So I've sort of written about this before but I think there is a trait of a
certain type of fiction (read: fiction I don't like), and the people who read
it, to use a flaw of the narrator as a pressure release valve for areas where
the story doesn't work for some reason.  The narrator has some issue that allows
the reader to release any problems they have with the story, _but that same flaw
isn't supposed to have any other effect on the story._

When Hariezer in HPMOR misses the mark with his scientific explanation, or acts
like so much of a twerp that the reader starts to notice, a reader can say
"well, he is just a young kid!"  BUT, we are never supposed to doubt the
received wisdom we get from Hariezer, and we are never supposed to doubt that he
is capable of interacting with the adults on their level.  Its just a pressure
release valve for when the arrogance and mis-fired science gets to be too much.

In Special Topics in Calamity Physics, when Blue's constant (and often
inappropriate) art and literature references get to be too much (or when the
reader notices that the tone is jarring and awful), we can chalk it up to her
upbringing by an obviously pretentious academic.  But we aren't suppose to doubt
that she is _actually cultured, smart, and educated._

In Name of the Wind, when Kvothe is just a bit too witty, or his music is
described as too beautiful, or his wizard gpa is just a bit too high, we can
chalk it up to the fact that he is a bit of a braggart telling his tale.  But we
are never supposed to doubt that the events in question _actually occurred._
For one thing, the events are completely mundane (Kvothe takes classes, Kvothe
jokes with friends, Kvothe looks for crush around town, Kvothe works to make
money. Lather, rinse,repeat for 400 pages.)

The author wants to have their cake and eat it too- they don't have to tone down
an issue (in these examples a mary sue, an overly-cute writing style, and a mary
sue), and people will Rorschach their way into seeing nuance where there isn't
any.

I'm not even sure HPMOR should be in that genre?  All the
science/experiments/rules of magic stuff stops around maybe chapter 25ish, never
to return.

People recommend Worm a lot, I haven't read it but it might be in the genre.

So I looked at FF.net, it seems at first glance that the same reviewer can
review every chapter and have it count as a different review?  So
"most-reviewed" might by a mix of both popular and long. HPMOR is certainly very
long.

Either way, we can agree HPMOR is _popular._  No doubt.

But is popular a measure of quality?  Transformers 4 was the highest grossing
film of 2014 by a wide margin.  It's also terrible in ways I simply don't have
the words to express.  I don't want to live in a world where I can't say that
Transformers 4 was a bad movie just because it was popular.

And finally - regarding the final parenthetical.  If you have to read a story
quickly and skim through it to get enjoyment out of it, its not a good story.
A good story, in my estimation, has word play or intricate construction and your
understanding and enjoyment is improved by close reading.

I'm not going to weigh in on the benefits of fanfic, but the last bit- is the
idea here that the goal of HPMOR is to recruit computer scientists and
mathematicians to work at MIRI?  Because a much,much easier way to do that is to
put up an add for a postdoc.

Given how young Less Wrong seems to be, HPMOR seems a good way to maybe recruit
highschool and early college students.

I think statements like this often come from a populist / anti-elitist sense
that "good art" basically means "art that people enjoy."  And therefore that
popularity is, if not a perfect one-to-one indication of whether something is
good, it's a pretty informative barometer.

(I don't know if this is what [hot-gay-rationalist][hot-gay-rationalist_tumblr]:
was thinking, but it's something you hear a lot from people who identify
strongly as "genre fiction fans" — stuff like "sci-fi / fantasy / mystery /
romance / etc. fiction are what really provide the things people want out of
fiction, and more 'sophisticated/literary' fiction is just highly valued because
of a bunch of historical accidents")

This kind of thinking works well in cases where the purpose of something is more
straightforward and there is only one kind of "taste."  Say, if you're buying
power tools, the fact that a certain tool is the most bought and best-reviewed
on Amazon doesn't necessarily mean it's good, but it's informative evidence.
And (I guess this is the analogy to fiction) if you found an alternative tool
that only a few people used, and those people wrote all these highfalutin'
essays about how good it was, and most of the Amazon reviews were like "I tried
to use this and it would not drill a hole, I wanted to drill a hole, 1 star" ...
well, you'd be kind of skeptical.

I have a bunch of problems with this view when applied to art, the main one
being that it just doesn't take into account that people's taste can change, and
that people can develop new tastes.  If something is hard to get into because it
makes a lot of references, that limits its appeal to people who know the
references, but it's possible to become someone who knows the references by
doing some background reading.  People can acquire new tastes, get bored of old
stuff and start to crave more variety, etc.  Generally, there aren't works of
art that are literally inaccessible in the sense that, like, you're not allowed
to read the book unless you're over 6 feet tall or something; there are barriers
to entry, but individuals can often do things to overcome those barriers.  (In
the power tools analogy, it's more like there being some really good tools out
there that are not very intuitive to use.  You're free to learn to use them,
it's just that inevitably, fewer people do.)

### hpmor chapter 85 {#ch85}

A return to my blogging obsession of old (which has been a slog for at least 20
chapters now, but if there is one thing that is true of all phds- we finish what
we fucking start, even if it's an awful idea).

This chapter is actually not so bad, mostly Hariezer just reflecting on the
difficulty of weighing his friends lives against "the cause" as Dumbledore
suggested he failed to do with Hermione in her trial a few chapters ago.

There are some good bits.  For instance, this interesting bit about bow and
arrow's in Australia:

  > A year ago, Dad had gone to the Australian National University in Canberra
  > for a conference where he'd been an invited speaker, and he'd taken Mum and
  > Harry along. And they'd all visited the National Museum of Australia,

And of course there are always some sections that filled me with rage-

Molecular nanotechnology is just the words that sci-fi authors (and Eric
Drexler) use for magic.  And the nearest black hole is probably something like
2000 light years away.  The reason people treat this stuff as far from their
personal reality is exactly the same reason Yudkowsky treats it as far from his
personal reality- IT IS.  Black holes are neat, and GR is a ton of fun, but we
aren't going to be engineering with black holes in my lifetime.

You know what would be awesome? IF YOU GOT AROUND TO DOING SOME EXPERIMENTS AND
EXPLORING THIS IDEA.  _The absolute essence of science_ is NOT asking these
questions, _it's deciding to try to find out the fucking answers!_ You can't be
content to just _wonder_ about things, you have to put the work in! Hariezer's
wonderment never gets past the stoned-college-kid wondering aloud and into
_ACTUAL_ exploration, and its getting really frustrating.  YOU PROMISED ME YOU
WERE GOING TO USE THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD TO LEARN THE SECRETS OF MAGIC.  WAY BACK
IN THE EARLY CHAPTERS.

Anyway, towards the end of the ruminations, Fawkes visits Hariezer and basically
offers to take him to Azkaban to try to take out the evil place.  Hariezer
(probably wisely) decides not to go.  And the chapter ends.

Was Japan ever as isolated as Australian populations?  I thought Japan was able
to trade with cultures on the mainland throughout it's history.  That's a much
larger population for idea diffusion.

Like...I'm surprised Death Eaters never transfigured critical hunks of Plutonium,
and that doesn't even break any rules.

If the moral of the story ends up being that we should stop doing science
because of the risk, I'm going to have more grounds on which to hate the story.

### hpmor chapter 86 {#ch86}

I just realized I have like 145 followers (HOLY SHIT!) and they probably came
for the HPMOR thing.  So I better keep the updates rolling!

Anyway, this chapter is basically Hariezer and friends (Dumbledore, Snape,
Mcgonagall, Mad-eye Moody) all trying to guess who might have been responsible
for trying to frame Hermione.  No real conclusions are drawn, not much to see
her.

A few notable things here- magic apparently works by the letter of the law,
rather than the spirit:

  > You say someone with the Dark Mark can't reveal its secrets to anyone who
  > doesn't already know them. So to find out how the Dark Mark operates, write
  > down every way you can imagine the Dark Mark might work, then watch

  > versus false statements, you see.

Luckily, Voldemort thought of the test, thus freeing Snape to tell how the mark
actually works:

  > The Dark Lord was no fool, despite Potter's delusions. The moment such a
  > test is suspected, the Mark ceases to bind our tongues. Yet I could not hint
  > at the possibility, but only wait for another to deduce it.

Why not just make sure the death eaters don't actually know the secrets of the
mark? Seems like memory spells are everywhere already, and it would be way
easier than this silly logic puzzle.

Finding out the secrets of the dark mark prompts Hariezer to try a Bayesian
estimate of whether Voldemort is actually dangerous.  I repeat that for
emphasis:

_Harry Potter, first year of Hogwarts who has only really succeeded at 1 thing
in his learn-the-science-of-magic plan (partial transfiguration), and who knows
he is not the most dangerous wizard at Hogwarts (Quirrel, Dumbledore), wonders
whether Voldemort could possibly be a threat._

Here are some of the things he considers:

  > Harry had been to a convocation of the Wizengamot. He'd seen the laughable
  > 'security precautions', if you could call them that, guarding the deepest
  > levels of the Ministry of Magic. They didn't even have the Thief's Downfall
  > which goblins used to wash away Polyjuice and Imperius Curses on people
  > entering Gringotts ... [if it] took you more than ten years to fail to
  > overthrow the government of magical Britain, it meant you were stupid.

But might they have some other precautions?  Maybe they use some sort of secret
precautions Harry himself doesn't yet know about yet?  Or might the wizards of
the Wizengamot be pretty powerful in their own right?

Dude, do you even Bayesian? Probability the dark mark still works _if Voldemort
is dead. ~0_ (everyone who knows magic thinks that the mark still existing is
proof he is still out there).  Given that Voldemort is alive, probability he
successfully complete some sort of immortality ritual ~1.  Probability someone
who completed an immortality ritual knows more magic than (and therefore is a
threat to) Hariezer Yudotter ~1.

So given that the dark mark is still around, Voldie is crazy dangerous,
regardless of priors or base rates.

It's helpful to look at where the information is, instead of trying to estimate
the probability Voldemort could have instantly killed some of the most powerful
wizards on the fucking planet.

Anyway....

OH, another thing that happens- Hariezer challenges Mad-eye to a little mini
duel.  Guess how he solves the problem of winning against Mad-eye?  Any ideas?
What could he use?  I'll give you a hint, it rhymes with time turner.  This
story really should be called Harry Potter And The Method of Time Turners.
Seriously- time turners solve basically all the problems in this book.  Anyway,
he goes to Flitwick, learns a bending spell, and then time turners back into the
room to pop Moody.

It's not actually a bad scene, there is a bit of action and it moves pretty
quickly.  The problem is that the time turner solution is so damn boring at this
point.

Also, we find out in this chapter that everyone believes Quirrell is really
somebody named David Monroe whose family was killed by Voldemort and who was a
leader during the war against Voldemort.

So we have some potential possibilities-

1. Voldemort was impersonating/half-invented the personality of David Monroe in
   order to play both sides during the war. After all, all of Monroe's family
   was killed but him.  Maybe all of Monroe's family was killed, including him,
   and Voldemort started impersonating the dead guy.  This could be a neat
   dynamic I guess.  Could "Voldemort" have been a Watchmen style plan to unite
   magical Britain against a common threat that went awry for Monroe/Riddle?
   Quirrell really did get body snatched in this scenario.  We could imagine an
   ending here where Monroe/Riddle are training Potter to be the leader of
   magical Britain that Monroe/Riddle wanted to be.

2. Monroe was a real dude, Voldemort body-snatched him, and now you've got
   Monroe brain fighting Voldemort brain inside.  For some reason, they are
   impersonating Quirrell?

If its not the first scenario, I'm going to be sort of annoyed, because scenario
2 doesn't provide us with much reason for the weird Monroe bit- you could just
give Quirrell all of Monroe's backstory.

Anyway, 86 chapters to go, I think this damn thing is going to clock in around
120 when all is said and done.  ::sigh:: Time for a scotch.

Now, this idea of positive/negative reinforcement is an old one, and goes back
to probably the psychologists associated with behaviorism (BF Skinner, Pavlov,
etc).

The weird thing is, there is no "Critch" I can find associated with the
behaviorists, or really any of the stuff attributed above.  I also emailed my
psych friend, who also has never heard of it (but "it's not really my field at
all").  I'm thinking there is like a 90% chance that Yudkowsky just invented a
scientist here?  Why not just say BF Skinner, or Pavlov here?  WHAT IS GOING ON
HERE?

Anyway, Hermione and Hariezer are brainstorming ways to make money when they get
into an argument because Hariezer has been sciencing with Draco:

  > "You were doing SCIENCE with him? "  
  > "Well -"  
  > "You were doing SCIENCE with him? You were supposed to be doing science with
  > ME! "

Hermione, I get it.  You wanted to figure out how magic works you've got some
curiosity about the world.  And now you think Hariezer kept his program going,
but cut you out of the big discoveries, will leave you off the publications. But
I've got news for you, girl, he hasn't been doing science **_WITH ANYONE_** for
like 60 chapters now.  HE JUST FORGOT ABOUT IT.

Anyway, this argument blows up, and Hariezer explains puberty:

  > But even with all that weird magical stuff letting me be more adult than I
  > should be, I haven't gone through puberty yet and there's no hormones in my
  > bloodstream and my brain is physically incapable of falling in love with
  > anyone. So I'm not in love with you! I couldn't possibly be in love with

And then drops some evopsych

To the story's credit, this works about as well as you'd expect and Hermione
storms off.

I think the evopsych dropping could have been sort of funny if it were played
more for laughs (Hariezer's inept way of calming Hermione down), but here it
just seems like a way to shoehorn this bit of evopsych into the story.

The final scene in the chapter is played for laughs, with another student coming
over after seeing Hermione storm off and saying "Witches! go figure, huh?"

### hpmor(.)com/notes/87/ explanation of Critch

Thanks.  For those who don't want to read the link- apparently Critch is a CFAR
instructor who developed a course on "psychology for mathematicians."  I'm not
sure this makes it better- when I teach a course on physics I don't expect my
students to then start citing "SU's work on classical mechanics"- it's Newton's
work, I'm just conveying it.

### Anonymous: IT'S HAPPENING! ...

> IT'S HAPPENING! HPMOR is finishing. Any chance you can catch up to the story
> and be ready to review the ending as soon as it comes out?

Probably not.  I'm making forward progress, but you know, "real" work, personal
projects, etc.  I won't rule it out completely, and I'll probably be close but
I'm not going to commit to it.

### HPMOR chapter 88. In which I complain about a lack of time turners {#ch88}

The problem with solving every problem in your story with time turners is that
it becomes incredibly conspicuous when you don't solve a problem with time
turners.

In this chapter, the bit of canon from book 1 with the troll in the dungeon is
introduced- someone comes running into the dining hall yelling troll.  Luckily,
Quirrell has the students well prepared:

  > Without any hesitation, the Defense Professor swung smoothly on the
  > Gryffindor table and clapped his hands with a sound like a floor cracking
  > through.
  >
  > "Michelle Morgan of House Gryffindor, second in command of Pinnini's Army,"
  > the Defense Professor said calmly into the resulting quiet. "Please advise
  > your Head of House."
  >
  > Michelle Morgan climbed up onto her bench and spoke, the tiny witch sounding
  > far more confident than Minerva remembered her being at the start of the
  > year. "Students walking through the hallways would be spread out and
  > impossible to defend. All students are to remain in the Great Hall and form
  > a cluster in the center... not surrounded by tables, a troll would jump right
  > over tables... with the perimeter defended by seventh-year students. From the
  > armies only, no matter how good they are at duelling, so they don't get in
  > each other's lines of fire."

So everyone will be safe from troll, but WAIT- Hariezer realizes Hermione is
missing.  What does he do?  Does he commit himself to time turning himself a
message telling him where Hermione is (to be fair, the time is noon, and the
earliest he can reach with a time turner is 3pm.  However he knows of another
student who uses a time turner and is willing to send messages with it, from the
post Azkaban escape.  He also knows other powerful wizards use time turners, so
he could ask one of them to pass the message,etc).

I suspect we are approaching _an important plot moment_ that time turnering
would somehow break.  Maybe we finally get a Quirrell reveal?  Anywho, it's
jarring to not see Hariezer go immediately for the time turner.  Instead he
tries to enlist the aid of other students (and not ask if anyone has a time
turner).

Anyway, Hariezer decides they need to go look for her as fast as possible- but
then

  > The witch he'd named turned from where she'd been staring steadily out at
  > the perimeter, her expression aghast for the one second before her face
  > closed up.
  >
  > "The Deputy Headmistress ordered us all to stay here, Mr. Potter."
  >
  > It took an effort for Harry to unclench his teeth. "Professor Quirrell
  > didn't say that and neither did you. Professor McGonagall isn't a tactician,
  > she didn't think to check if we had missing students and she thought it was
  > a good idea to start marching students through the hallways. But Professor
  > McGonagall understands after her mistakes are pointed out to her, you saw
  > how she listened to you and Professor Quirrell, and I'm certain that she
  > wouldn't want us to just ignore the fact that Hermione Granger is out there,
  > alone -"

So Hariezer flags this as

  > Harry's brain flagged this as I'm talking to NPCs again and he spun on his
  > heel and dashed back for the broomstick.

Yes, Hariezer, in this world you are talking to NPCs- characters Yudkowsky wrote
in, entirely to be stupid so that you can appear brilliant.

Anyway, he rushes off the Weasley twins to go find Hermione, and just as he
finds her the chapter ends.  I look forward to tuning in next time for the
thrilling conclusion.

### HPMOR Chapter 89 grimdark {#ch89}

There will be spoilers ahead.  Although if you cared about spoilers why are you
reading this?

So I thought the plot moment we were leading up to was a Quirrell reveal and I
was dead wrong (a pun, because Hermione dies).  By the time Hariezer arrives,
Hermione has already been troll smashed (should have used the time turner,bro).

A brief battle scene ensues in which the Weasleys fail to be very effective,
andHariezer kills the troll by floating his father's rock (which he has been
wearing in a ring) into the trolls mouth and then letting it go back to its
original size, which pops the troll head.

Hermione then utters her final words "not your fault" and then dies. Hariezer is
obviously upset by this.

Not a bad chapter really, even though it required a sort "rationality failure"
involving the time turners to get here.  Normally I wouldn't care about this
sort of thing, but the fact that _basically every problem thus far was solved
with time turners_ makes it very hard to suspend my disbelief here.  It feels a
touch to much like characters are doing things just to make the plot happen (and
not following their 'natural' actions).

I fear the next ten chapters will be just reflections on this (instead of things
happening).

### If I read too many chapters in a row on HPMOR

I get sort of irrationally angry at everything.

Or maybe thats the scotch.

### HPMOR Chapter 90 Hariezer's lack of self reflection {#ch90}

Brief note- it's mardi gras, and I'm about as over served as I ever have been. I
LIKE HOW OVER SERVED AS A PHRASE BLAMES THE BARTENDER AND NOT ME. THIS IS A
THEME FOR THIS CHAPTER. Anyway, hopefullly this will not lack my usual (non)
eloquence.

This chapter begins what appears to be a 9 part section on Hariezer trying to
cope with the death of his friend.

As the chapter opens, Hariezer cools Hermione's body to try to preserve it.  I
guess that will slow decay, but probably not by enough to matter.

And then Hariezer gets understandably mopey.  Everyone is concerned he is
withdrawing from the world, so Mcgonagall goes to talk to him and we get this
bit:

  > "Nothing I could have done? " Harry's voice rose on the last word. "Nothing
  > I could have...Or if I'd just approached the whole problem from a different
  > angle - **if I'd looked for a student with a Time-Turner to send a message
  > back in time.**

It's the one in bold that is especially troubling because the time turner is
seriously what Hariezer always turns to (TURNS TO! GET IT! IT'S AN AWFUL PUN).
When your character is defined by his munchkining ability to solve problems via
time turner, and the one time he doesn't go for the time turner a major plot
point happens, it's jarring to the reader.  Almost as if characters are behaving
entirely to make the plot happen...

Anyway,

  > She was aware now that tears were sliding down her cheeks, again. "Harry -
  > Harry, you have to believe that this isn't your fault!"
  >
  > "Of course it's my fault. There's no one else here who could be responsible
  > for anything."
  >
  > "No! You-Know-Who killed Hermione!" She was hardly aware of what she was
  > saying, that she hadn't screened the room against who might be listening.
  > "Not you! No matter what else you could've done, it's not you who killed
  > her, it was Voldemort! If you can't believe that you'll go mad, Harry!"
  >
  > "That's not how responsibility works, Professor." Harry's voice was patient,
  > like he was explaining things to a child who was certain not to understand.
  > He wasn't looking at her anymore, just staring off at the wall to her right
  > side. "When you do a fault analysis, there's no point in assigning fault to
  > a part of the system you can't change afterward

So keep this in mind- Hariezer says it't no use blaming anyone but himself,
because he can't change their actions.  This seems like a silly NPC/PC
distinction- no one can change their past actions, but everyone can learn how
they could have improved things.

  > "All right, then," Harry said in a monotone. "I tried to do the sensible
  > thing, when I saw Hermione was missing and that none of the Professors knew.

What exactly does Hariezer think she should have said here?  If a fire had
broken out in the meal hall does Hariezer think that everyone would have stayed
in the cafeteria and burned to death out of fear of Mcgonagall?  Also, it
certainly sounds as if Hariezer has plenty of blame for people not himself.  "I
only blame me, but also you suck in the following ways..."

  > But normal people don't choose on the basis of consequences, they just play
  > roles. There's a picture in your head of a stern disciplinarian and you do
  > whatever that picture would do, whether or not it makes any sense....People
  > like you aren't responsible for anything, people like me are, and when we
  > fail there's no one else to blame."

I AM THE ONLY PC, YOU ARE ALL NPC.  I AM THE ONLY FULL HUMAN.  TREMBLE BEFORE MY
AGENTYNESS.  I get that Harizer is mourning, but is their any more condescending
way to mourn?  "Everything is my fault because you aren't all even fully human?"
You are a fucking twerp Hariezer, even when you mourn.

  > His hand darted beneath his robes, brought forth the golden sphere that was
  > the Ministry-issued protective shell of his Time Turner. He spoke in a dead,
  > level voice without any emphasis. "This could've saved Hermione, if I'd been
  > able to use it. But you thought it was your role to shut me down and get in
  > my way.

No, Hariezer, you were told **THERE WERE RULES and you violated them.** You
yourself have said that time travel can be dangerous and you were using it
because Snape asked questions you didn't know the answer to, and really to solve
any trivial problem.  **You broke the rules,** and it locked your time turner
down when you might have really wanted it.  Total boy-who-cried-wolf situation,
and **yet its conspicuously absent from your discussion above- you blame
yourself in lots of ways, but not in this way.**

  > Unable to speak, she brought forth her wand and did so, releasing the
  > time-keyed enchantment she'd laced into the shell's lock.

The only lessons learned from this are other character "updating towards" the
idea that Hariezer Yudotter is always right.  And he fails when other people
have prevented his natural PC based awesomenes.

Anyway, Mcgonagall sends in the big guns (Quirrell) to try to talk to Hariezer,
which leads Hariezer to say to him:

  > The boy's voice was razor-sharp. "I'd forgotten there was someone else in
  > Hogwarts who could be responsible for things."

And later in the conversation:

  > "You did want to save her. You wanted it so strongly that you made some sort
  > of actual effort. I suppose your mind, if not theirs, would be capable of
  > that."

So you see- it's clearly not about assigning himself all the blame (because he
can only change his own actions), it's about separating the world into 'real
people' and 'NPCs'   Only real people can get any blame for anything, everyone
else is just window dressing.  Maybe it's a pet peeve, but I react in abhorrence
to this "you aren't even human enough to share some blame" schtick.

8 more chapters in this fucking section.

So I had a post complaining about this-
[http://su3su2u1.tumblr.com/post/98874313003/chapter-39-your-transhumanism-is-showing](#chapter-39--your-transhumanism-is-showing)

The issue I had is that the fantasy genre is a uniquely bad genre in which to
argue against an afterlife (as Hariezer does in that chapter) because you have
to discount evidence like "that gateway to the afterlife living in the ministry
of magic."

And I think this a good example of the post I made here

[http://su3su2u1.tumblr.com/post/109276679888/narrator-as-pressure-release-valve](#narrator-as-pressure-release-valve)
I think a lot of readers feel the same tension I feel, but are more willing to
resolve the tension by assuming Harry in the story is wrong about something, or
just being a kid,etc.

### HPMOR Chapter 91 {#ch91}

Total retread of the last chapter.  Hariezer is still blaming himself, Snape
tries to talk to him. They bring his parents in to try to talk to him.  Nothing
here really.

### HPMOR Chapter 92 {#ch92}

Really, still nothing here.  Quirrell is also concerned about Hariezer, but as
before his concern seems less than totally genuine.  I fear this arc is
basically just a lot of retreads.

### HPMOR Chapter 93 {#ch93}

Still very little going on in these chapters...

So Mcgonagall completes the transformation she began two chapters ago, and
realizes rules are for suckers and Hariezer is always right

  > "I am ashamed," said Minerva McGonagall, "of the events of this day. I am

Maybe I'm projecting too much of canon McGonagall onto my reading of this one in
this fanfic, but has she really been stamping out all defiance and overly stern?
Would any student really have believed they would have expelled for trying to
help find a missing student in a dire situation?

Hariezer certainly wasn't expelled (or punished in anyway) for his experimenting
with transfiguration/discovering partial transfiguration.  He was punished for
flaunting his time turner despite explicit instructions not to... But in a
school for magic users, that is probably a necessity.

Also, Hermione's body has gone missing.  I suspect Hariezer is cryonicsing it.

### HPMOR Chapter 94 {#ch94}

This is the best chapter of this "reflect on what just happened" giant block of
chapters, but that's not saying much.

Hariezer might not have taken Hermione's body, but seems unconcerned that it's
missing (maybe he took it to freeze the brain, maybe Voldie took it to resurrect
Hermione or brain upload her or something).  That's the only real thing of merit
that happens in this chapter (a conversation between Dumbledore and Hariezer, a
conversation between Neville and Hariezer).

Hariezer has finally convinced himself that Voldemort is smart, which leads to
this rumination

  > Okay, serious question. If the enemy is that smart, why the heck am I still
  > alive? Is it seriously that hard to poison someone, are there Charms and
  > Potions and bezoars which can cure me of literally anything that could be

  > whatshername and framing Mr. Hagrid. Obvious problem 2, there's no such
  > thing as souls.

So, all the readers are already on board this train, because they've read the
canon novel, so I guess it's nice that the "super rationalist" is considering it
(although Voldemort is smart, therefore I have a Voldemort fragment trying to
possess me is a huge leap.  You didn't even Bayes that shit bro).

But seriously, "there's no such thing as souls?"  SO DON'T CALL IT A SOUL, CALL
IT A MAGIC RESURRECTION FRAGMENT.  Are we really getting hung up on semantics?

These chapter are intensely frustrating because any "rising action" in this
story (we are nearing the conclusion after all) is blunted because after
anything happens, we need 10 chapters for everyone to talk about everything and
digest the events.  The ratio of words/plot is ridiculously huge.

We do maybe get a bit of self-reflection when Neville tries to blame himself for
Hermione's death:

  > "Wow," the empty air finally said. "Wow. That puts a pretty different
  > perspective on things, I have to say. I'm going to remember this the next
  > time I feel an impulse to blame myself for something. Neville, the term in

  > Neville Longbottom for what happened to Hermione. Not for a fraction of a
  > second. You are being, if you will pardon the phrase, a silly-dilly. Now

It would be nice for Hariezer to more explicitly use this to come to terms with
his own grieving (instead of insisting on "heroic responsibility" for himself a
few sections back, and also insisting it's McGonagall's fault for trying to
enforce rules, and now insisting that blaming yourself is egocentric bias).  I
hope this is Hariezer realizing that he shouldn't blame himself, and growing a
bit, but fear this is Hariezer suggesting that Neville isn't important enough to
blame.

Anyway, Hariezer insists that Neville leave for awhile to help keep him safe.

Ghosts exist, so clearly something is capable of being imprinted.  It doesn't
matter if you call it a "soul" or a wizard-portrait-like copy of Voldemort.  My
point is that Hariezer took a concept, named it soul and then said "souls don't
exist" in order to argue against the idea that Voldemort has imprinted via his
scar (which is weird, because the reader has been assuming that's what
Hariezer's dark side is from the beginning, because we've read the canon books).

And yes, because magic exists every single assumption based on science has to be
revisited.

You are missing the point.  It doesn't matter whether a "soul" exists, what
matters is whether or not it's possible for a wizard's mind to be somehow
imprinted on Hariezer.

### Bad mood

I've been in a bad mood for a few days and realized today it was my attempt to
read more HPMOR to get caught up... ::sigh:: this fucking story...

### HPMOR Chapter 95 {#ch95}

So the chapter opens with more incuriousness, which is the rest of the chapter
in miniature:

  > Harry had set the alarm upon his mechanical watch to tell him when it was
  > lunchtime, since he couldn't actually look at his wrist, being invisible and
  > all that. It raised the question of how his eyeglasses worked while he was

  > both. It really did seem increasingly likely that invisibility cloaks let
  > you see outward while being invisible yourself because, on some fundamental
  > level, that was how the caster had - not wanted - but implicitly believed -
  > that invisibility should work.

This would be an excellent fucking question to explore, maybe via some
experiments.  But no.  I've totally given up on this story exploring the magic
world in any detail at all.  Anyway, Hariezer skips straight from "I wonder how
this works" to "it must work this way, how could we exploit it"

  > Whereupon you had to wonder whether anyone had tried Confunding or
  > Legilimizing someone into implicitly and matter-of-factly believing that

  > beginning, they'd have a different idea of what magic could do.
This skips all the interesting hard work of science.

The majority of the chapter is a long discussion between Quirrell and Hariezer
where Quirrell tries to convince Hariezer not to try to raise the dead.  It's
too dangerous, may end the universe, etc.

Lots of discussion about how special Quirrell and Hariezer are because only they
would even think to fight death,etc.  It's all a boring retread of ideas already
explored in earlier chapters,etc.

It reads a lot like any discussion of cryonics with a cryonics true believer:

  > The Defense Professor's voice was also rising. "The Transfiguration
  > Professor is reading from a script, Mr. Potter! That script calls for her to
  > mourn and grieve, that all may know how much she cared. Ordinary people
  > react poorly if you suggest that they go off-script. As you already knew!"

Also, it's sloppy world building- do we really think no wizards in the HPMOR
universe have spent time investigating death/spells to reverse aging/spells to
deal with head injuries,etc?

THERE IS A RESURRECTION STONE AND A LITERAL GATEWAY TO THE AFTERLIFE IN THE
BASEMENT OF THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC.  Maybe Hariezer's FIRST FUCKING STOP if he
wanted to investigate bringing back the dead SHOULD BE THAT GATE.    Maybe some
scientific experiments?

It's like the above incuriousness with the invisibility cloak (and the typical
transhumanist approach to science)- assume all the problems are solved and
imagine what the world be like, how dangerous that power _might_ be.  This is no
way to explore a question.  It's not even producing a very interesting story.

Quirrell assumes Hariezer might end the world even though he has shown 0
aptitude with any magic even approaching dangerous...

### HPMOR 96 More of the same {#ch96}

Remus takes Hariezer to Godric's Hollow to try to cheer him up or whatever.

Hariezer discovers the Potter's family motto is apparently the passage from
Corinthians:

  > The Last Enemy to Be Destroyed is Death

Hariezer is super glad that his family has a long history of trying to end
death, and (at least) realizes that other wizards have tried.  Of course, the
idea of _actually looking at their research_ doesn't fucking occur to him
because this story is very silly.

We get this rumination from Hariezer on the Peverell's 'deathly hallows' from
the books:

  > Hiding from Death's shadow is not defeating Death itself. The Resurrection
  > Stone couldn't really bring anyone back. The Elder Wand couldn't protect you
  > from old age.

HOW THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW THE RESURRECTION STONE CAN'T BRING ANYONE BACK?  HAVE
YOU EVEN SEEN IT?

Step 1- assume that the resurrection stone doesn't work because you can't
magically bring back the dead

Step 2- decide you want to magically resurrect the dead

Step 3- never revisit step 1.

SCIENCE!

GO INVESTIGATE THE DOORWAY TO THE AFTERLIFE! GO TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT THE
RESURRECTION STONE!  DO SOME FUCKING RESEARCH!  "I'm going to resurrect the dead
by thinking really hard about how much death sucks _and doing nothing else."_

Pretty much, yes.

### Chapter 97 plot points resolved arbitrarily {#ch97}

nNext on the list to talk with Hariezer regarding Hermione's death? The Malfoys
who call Hariezer to Gringotts under the pretense of talking about Hariezer's
debt.

On the way in he passes a goblin, which prompts this

  > If I understand human nature correctly - and if I'm right that all the
  > humanoid magical species are genetically human plus a heritable magical
  > effect -

How did you come to that conclusion Hariezer?  What did you do to study it?  Did
you just make it up with no justification whatsoever?  This story confuses
science jargon for science.

Anyway, Lucious is worried that he'll be blamed for Hermione's death (although
given that it has already been established that the wizard court votes exactly
as he wants it to I'm not sure why he is worried about it) so he agrees to
cancel Hariezer's debt and return all his money if Hariezer swears Lucious
didn't have anything to do with the troll that killed Hermione.

This makes very little sense- why would anyone listen to Hariezer on this?
Hariezer doesn't actually know that the Malfoys weren't involved.   If he is
asked "how do you know?" he'll have to say "I don't."  If he Bayesed that shit,
the Malfoys should be near the fucking top of the suspect list...

Anyway, the Malfoys try to convince Hariezer that Dumbledore killed Hermione as
some sort of multi-level plot.

I'm so bored.

### Chapter 98- This block is nearly over! {#ch98}

The agreement put in place in the previous chapter is enacted.

Malfoy announces to Hogwarts that Hermione was innocent. Hariezer says there is
no ill will between the Potters and the Malfoys.  Why did we even need this
fucking scene?

Through backstage maneuvering by Hariezer and Malfoy,the Hogwarts board of
governors enacts some rules for safety of students (travel in packs, work
together,etc).  Why they needed the maneuvering I don't know (just ask
McGonagall to implement whatever rules you want. No effort required).

Also, Neville was sent away from Hogwarts like.. three chapters ago.  But now he
is in Hogwarts and stands up to read some of the rules? And Draco, who was
closer to Hariezer, returns to Hogwarts?  This makes no sense given Hariezer's
fear for his friends?  "No one is safe! Wait, I changed my mind even though
nothing has happened."

There was also a surreal moment where the second worst thing I've ever read
referenced the first:

  > "Remind me to buy you a copy of the Muggle novel Atlas Shrugged,"

### HPMOR Chapter 99 {#ch99}

This chapter is literally one sentence long. Unicorn died at Hogwarts.  Why not
just slap it into the previous chapter?

I do appear to have been proven wrong.

But yes, the story could very clearly use an editor, rearranging and editing.
I'd bet a competent editor could easily cut the length of this thing down by a
factor of 5 at least.   You don't need 10 chapters of everyone talking about an
event immediately after an event happens.  Chopping out all the repetitive
writing quirks (always referring to families as "noble and most ancient
houses"), dropping all the unfulfilled stuff from the first 20-30 chapters (all
the science references really).

My biggest problem though (other than the ridiculous bloat) though is all the
mis-fired science references.  Like... peppering _slightly wrong_ science
throughout is bound to hurt my enjoyment of a story.   And then consistently
having people recommend a story to me because the characters _are supposed to be
scientific_ and having said characters studiously avoid doing any science.... No
way I can enjoy that...

The conceit of this story, for the first 30ish chapters is that Hariezer is
going to use science to explore magic.  That is the dominant plot thread.  It
then stops, completely.

And honestly, Hariezer isn't written as a caricature, he is written as the hero.
His jargon dumping of physics mad libs, his intelligence trumps all/nerd
elitism,etc. is played totally straight- it never gets him into trouble, never
causes him issues,etc.  It's clear that the author doesn't realize how much
science he hasn't gotten right.

I would love a story that actually tried to put some rules around the magic,
actually explored the consequences of those rules,etc.  This story is not it.

First, the resurrection stone really _is_ one of the three most valuable magical
artifacts in the world.

Second, Quirrell wraps the whole thing up in "I suspect," and makes no mention
of the specific devices he has seen.  Why is the resurrection stone so much more
valuable than these other "devices said to communicate with the dead?"

The resurrection stone, the arch in the basement of the ministry,etc these are
bits of canon hugely inconvenient for what is turning out to be the dominant
themes of this story, and having Hariezer just dismiss them as obvious fraud is
just lazy.

### HPMOR Chapter 100 {#ch100}

Remember that mysterious bit about the unicorns dying? That merited a whole
one-sentence chapter?  Luckily, it's totally resolved in this chapter.

Borrowing a scene from canon, we have Draco and some slytherin palls (working to
fix the school) investigating the forest with Hagrid as part of a detention.
This leads to a variant of an old game theory/cs joke:

  > Meself," Hagrid continued, "I think we might 'ave a Parisian hydra on our
  > 'ands. They're no threat to a wizard, yeh've just got to keep holdin' 'em
  > off long enough, and there's no way yeh can lose. I mean literally no way
  > yeh can lose so long's yeh keep fightin'. Trouble is, against a Parisian
  > hydra, most creatures give up long before. Takes a while to cut down all the
  > heads, yeh see."
  >
  > "Bah," said the foreign boy. "In Durmstrang we learn to fight Buchholz
  > hydra. Unimaginably more tedious to fight! I mean literally, cannot imagine.
  > First-years not believe us when we tell them winning is possible! Instructor
  > must give second order, iterate until they comprehend."
This time, it's just Draco and friends in detention, no Hariezer/

When Draco encounters the unicorn killer, all of a sudden Hariezer and aurors
come riding in to save the day:

  > After Captain Brodski had learned that Draco Malfoy was in the Forbidden
  > Forest, seemingly in the company of Rubeus Hagrid, Brodski had begun
  > inquiring to find out who had authorized this, and had still been unable to
  > find out when Draco Malfoy had missed check-in. Despite Harry's protests,
  > the Auror Captain, who was authorized to know about Time-Turners, had
  > refused to allow deployment to before the time of the missed check-in; there
  > were standard procedures involving Time. But Brodski had given Harry written
  > orders allowing him to go back and deploy an Auror trio to arrive one second
  > after the missed check-in time.

So... why does Hariezer come with the aurors?  For what purpose? He is always
talking about avoiding danger,etc so why ride into danger when the battle
wizards will probably be enough?

Anyway, we all know its Quirrell killing unicorns, so I'll skip to the
Hariezer/Quirrell interaction:

  > "I don't know it," Harry said.

He knows literally nothing about unicorns here, nothing about what the side
effects are,etc.  I know lots of doctors who have living wills because they
aren't ok with the side effects of certain life-preserving treatments.

This feels again like canon is fighting the transhumanist message the author
wants to insert.

### HPMOR chapter 101 {#ch101}

Still in the woods, Hariezer encounters a centaur who tries to kill him, because
he divines that Hariezer is going to make all the stars die.

There are some standard anti-astrology arguments, which again seems to be
fighting the actual situation because the centaurs successfully use astrology to
divine things.

We get this:

  > "Cometary orbits are also set thousands of years in advance so they
  > shouldn't correlate much to current events. And the light of the stars takes
  > years to travel from the stars to Earth, and the stars don't move much at
  > all, not visibly. So the obvious hypothesis is that centaurs have a native
  > magical talent for Divination which you just, well, project onto the night
  > sky."

There are so, so many other hypothesis Hariezer.  Maybe starlight has a magical
component that waxes and wanes as stars align into different magical symbols are
some such.  The HPMOR scientific method:

observation -> generate 1 hypothesis -> assume you are right -> it turns out
that you are right.

Quirrell saves Hariezer and I guess in the aftermath Filch and Hagrid both get
sacked (we aren't actually shown this, instead Dumbledore and Hariezer have a
discussion about it, because _why show when you can have characters talk about!
So much more interesting!)_

Anyway, Dumbeldore is a bit sad by the loss of Filch and especially Hagrid, but
Hariezer says

  > "Your mistake," Harry said, looking down at his knees, feeling at least ten
  > percent as exhausted as he'd ever been, "is a cognitive bias we would call,
  > in the trade, scope insensitivity. Failure to multiply. You're thinking

  > percent of them being scalded by Ashwinders. No one student would be hurt as
  > much as Mr. Hagrid would be happy, but there'd be a hundred students being

First "in the trade"?  Really?

Anyway, Hariezer isn't multiplying in the _obvious tangible benefits of an
enthusiastic teacher who really knows his shit regarding magical creatures.
Yes, more students will be scalded but its because there will be SUPER AWESOME
LESSONS WHERE KIDS COULD BE SCALDED!_

In the balance, I think Hariezer was right about Filch and Dumbledore was right
about Hagrid.

Anyway, thats it for this chapter, its a standard "chapter where people do
nothing that talk."

Harry Potter and the Methods of Expository Dialogue.

### HPMOR chapter 102 open borders and death spells {#ch102}

Quirrell is still dying, Hariezer brings him a unicorn he turned into a stone.

We learn how horcruxes work in this world:

  > Only one who doess not believe in common liess will reasson further, ssee
  > beneath obsscuration, realisse how to casst sspell. Required murder iss not
  > ssacrificial ritual at all. Ssudden death ssometimes makess ghosst, if magic

  > ghosst in sspecial device. Ssecond victim pickss up horcrux device, device
  > imprintss your memoriess into them. But only memoriess from time horcrux
  > device wass made. You ssee flaw?"

Wait? A ghost has all the memories of the person who died? Why isn't Hariezer
reading everything he can about how these imprints work?  If the Horcrux can
transfer ghost-like stuff into a person, could you return any ghost to a new
body?  I feel like Hariezer just says "I'm going to end death! Humanity should
end death! I can't believe no one is trying to end death!" But he isn't actually
doing anything about it himself.

Also, if that is how a horcrux works _WHY THE FUCK WOULD VOLDEMORT PUT ONE ON A
PIONEER PROBE?_  The odds of that encountering people again are pretty much nill.
At least we've learned horcruxes aren't conscious- I had assumed Voldemort had
condemned one of his copies to an eternity of isolation.

We also learn that in HPMOR world

So standard open borders stuff, not worth spending time with.

But I want to talk about the magic here- apparently you can only cast the
killing curse at people you hate, and toward people you are indifferent toward.
So you can't kill your loved ones! Big limitation!

Also, Hariezer "99% of the fucking planet is NPCs" Yudotter isn't indifferent to
anyone?  I call BS.

### Chapter 103 Very Punny {#ch103}

Credit where credit is due, this whole chapter sets up a pretty clever pun.

The students take an exam, and then receive their final "battle magic" grades.
Hermione is failed because she made the mistake of dying.  Hariezer gets an
exceeds expectations, which Quirrell informs Hariezer "It is the same grade...
that I received in my own first year."

Get it?  He marked him as an equal.

Exactly this!  Even worse, the original premise of the story as suggested by the
story was using the scientific method to discover the secrets of magic- i.e.
figuring out a new prior by learning the rules of magic,etc.  The driving plot
thread of the first 30ish chapters is then totally dropped,in favor of just
seeing something magical and immediately inferring how it worked.

He makes HUGE snap judgements with no evidence (the bit about astrology with the
centaur, for instance)   Most of these asides have nothing to do with the plot,
but the resurrection stone, ghosts, and the arch in the ministry basement are
all huge pieces of magic that conceivably would help Harry's goal of reversing
death.  But he spends 0 time studying them.

His plan to end death seems to be "whine real loud about how people don't fight
death enough"- which come to think of it is pretty much the transhumanist plan.

### Chapter 104 Plot threads hastily tied up/also some nonsense {#ch104}

So this chapter opens with a quidditch game, in an attempt to wrap up an earlier
plot thread- Quirrell's reward for his battle game (a reward given out back in
chapter 34 or so, and literally never mentioned again until this chapter) was
that slytherin and ravenclaw would tie for the house cup and Hogwarts would stop
playing quidditch with the snitch.

Going into this game, Hufflepuff is in the lead for house cup "by something like
five hundred points."  Quirrell is out of commission with his sickness, but the
students have taken matters into their own hands- it appears the plan is just to
not catch the snitch?

  > It was at eight pm and six minutes, according to Harry's watch, when
  > Slytherin had just scored another 10 points bringing the score to 170-140,
  > when Cedric Diggory leapt out of his seat and shouted "Those bastards!"
  >
  > "Yeah!" cried a young boy beside him, leaping to his own feet. "Who do they

  > "Not that!" cried Cedric Diggory. "They're - they're trying to steal the Cup
  > from us! "
  >
  > "But we're not in the running any more for -"
  >
  > "Not the Quidditch Cup! The House Cup!"

What?  It's totally unclear to me how this is supposed to work.  In the books,
as I remember it, points were awarded for winning quidditch games NOT for simply
scoring points within a quidditch game?  Winning 500 to 500 will just result in
some fixed amount of points going to the winner.

Also, there appears to be a misunderstanding of quidditch:

  > The game had started at six o' clock in the afternoon. A typical game would
  > have gone until seven or so, at which point it would have been time for
  > dinner.

No, as I recall, games go on for days not one hour.  I think the books mention a
game lasting longer than a month.  No one would be upset at a game where the
snitch hasn't been caught in a few hours.

Basically, this whole thing feels really ill-conceived.

Luckily, the chapter pivots away from the quidditch game pretty quickly,
Hariezer gets a letter from himself.

I note that Hariezer established way back when somewhere that he has a system in
place to communicate with himself, with secret codes for his notes to make sure
they really are for him.  I'm too lazy to dig this back up, but I definitely
remember reading it.  Probably in chapter 13 with the time travel game?

Anyway, apparently Hariezer has forgotten this (I hope this comes up and it's
not just a weird problem introduced for no reason?)  because this turns out to
be a decoy note from Quirrell to lure him to the forbidden corridor.  After a
whole bunch of people all show up at the forbidden corridor at the same time,
and some chaos breaks out, Hariezer and Quirrell are the last men standing,
which leads to this:

We also indirectly find out that Quirrell killed Hermione (but we already knew
that), although he did it by controlling professor Sprout (I guess to throw off
the scent if he got caught?)

Anyway, this pivotal plot moment seems to _rely entirely on the fact that
Hariezer forgot his own coded note system?_

### HPMOR Chapter 105 {#ch105}

So Quirrell gets Hariezer to cooperate with him, by threatening students, and
offering to resurrect Hermione if he gets the philosopher's stone

And know this, I have taken hostages. I have already set in motion a spell that
will kill hundreds of Hogwarts students, including many you called friends. I
can stop that spell using the Stone, if I obtain it successfully. If I am
interrupted before then, or if I choose not to stop the spell, hundreds of
students will die. Hariezer does manage to extract a concession:

  > Agreed," hissed Professor Quirrell. "Help me, and you sshall have ansswerss
  > to your quesstions, sso long ass they are about passt eventss, and not my
  > planss for the future. I do not intend to raisse my hand or magic againsst

  > Now promisse that you will not attempt to warn againsst me or esscape.
  > Promisse to put forth your own besst efforts toward helping me to obtain the
  > Sstone. And your girl-child friend sshall be revived by me, to true life and
  > health; nor sshall me or mine ever sseek to harm her." A twisted smile.
  > "Promisse, boy, and the bargain will be sstruck."

So coming up we'll get one of those chapters where the villain explains
everything.  Always a good sign when the villain does _apparently nothing_ for
90 or so out of 100 chapters, and then explains the significance of everything
at the very end.

### HPMOR 106 {#ch106}

Not much happens here, Quirrell kills the 3 headed cerberus to get past the
first puzzle.  When Hariezer points out that might have alerted someone,
Quirrell is all "eh, I fucked all the wards up."

So I guess more time to go before we get the villain monologue chapter.

### Chapter 107 still no monologue {#ch107}

Still no villain monologue.  Quirrell and Hariezer encounter the other puzzles
from the book, and Quirrell blasts them to death with magic fire rather than
actually solve them.

However, Quirrell has some random reasons to not blast apart the potion room (he
respects Snape or something, blah,bah).  Anyway, apparently this means he'll
have to make a long and complicated potion, which will give Quirrell and
Hariezer some time to talk.

Side note: credit where credit is due, I again notice these chapters flow much
better, and have a much smoother writing style.  There is some wit in the way
that Quirrell just hulk-smashes all the puzzles (although stopping at Snape;s
puzzle seems like a contrived way to drop the monologue we know is coming next
chapter or so into the story) _When things are happening,_ HPMOR can be decently
written.

### HPMOR Chapter 108 monologue {#ch108}

So we get the big "explain everything" monologue, and it's kind of a let down?

The first secret we get- Hariezer is _indeed_ a copy of Voldemort (which was
just resolving some dramatic irony, we all knew this because we read the books).
In a slight twist, we find out that he was intentionally a horcrux-

  > It occurred to me how I might fulfill the Prophecy my own way, to my own
  > benefit. I would mark the baby as my equal by casting the old horcrux spell
  > in such fashion as to imprint my own spirit onto the baby's blank slate... I
  > would arrange with the other Tom Riddle that he should appear to vanquish
  > me, and he would rule over the Britain he had saved. We would play the game
  > against each other forever, keeping our lives interesting amid a world of
  > fools.

But apparently creating the horcrux created some sort of magic resonance and
killed his body.  But he had somehow made true-immortal horcruxes.
Unfortunately, he had put them stupid places like on the pioneer probe or in
volcanos where people would never touch them, so he never managed to find a host
(remember when I complained about that a few chapters back?)

Hariezer does point out that Voldemort should have tested the new horcrux spell.
He suggests Voldie failed to do so because he doesn't think about doing nice
things, but Voldie could have just horcruxed someone, killed them to test it,
then destroyed the horcrux, then killed them for real.  Not nice, pretty
straightforward. It feels like this is going to be Voldemort's weakness that
gets exploited.

We find out that the philosopher's stone makes transfigurations permanent, which
I guess is a minor twist on the traditional legend?  Really, just a specific way
of making it work- in the legends it can transmute metals, heal sickness, bring
dead plants back to life, let you make homunculi,etc.

In HPMOR, powerful magical artifacts can't have been produced recently, because
lore is lost of whatever, so we get a grimdark history of the stone, involving a
Hogwarts student seducing professor Baba Yaga to trick her into taking her
virginity so she could steal the stone.  Really incidental to anything. Anyway,
Flamel, who stole the stone, is both man and woman and uses the stone to
transmute back and forth, and apparently gave Dumbledore power to fight
Grindlewald.

Quirrell killed Hermione (duh) because

  > I killed Miss Granger to improve your position relative to that of Lucius
  > Malfoy, since my plans did not call for him to have so much leverage over
  > you.

I don't think this actually makes much sense at all?  It's pretty clear Voldie
plans to kill Hariezer as soon as this is over, so why should he care about
Malfoy at all in this?  I had admittedly assume he killed Hermione to help his
dark side take over Hariezer or something.

Apparently they raided Azkaban to find out where Black had hidden Quirrell's
wand.

Also, as expected, Voldemort was _both_ Monroe and Voldemort and was playing
both sides in order to gain political power.  He wanted to get political power
because he was afraid muggles would destroy the world.

Basically, _every single reveal_ is basically what you'd expect from the books.
Harry Potter and The Obvious Villain Monologue.

The only open question is why the Hariezer-crux, given how that spell is
supposed to work, didn't have any of Voldemort's memories up until that time?  I
expect we are supposed to chalk it up to "the spell didn't quite work because of
the resonance that blew everything up" or whatever.

### Chapter 109 supreme author wank {#ch109}

We get to the final mirror, and we get this bit of author wank:

  > Upon a wall of metal in a place where no one had come for centuries, I found
  > written the claim that some Atlanteans foresaw their world's end, and sought

Get it? It's friendly AI and we are all living in Atlantis! And Yud is bravely
toiling away in obscurity to save us all!  (Note: toiling in obscurity in this
context means soliciting donations to continue running one of the least
productive research organizations in existence.)

Anyway, after this bit of wankery, Voldie and Hariezer return to the problem of
how to get the stone.  The answer turns out to be by confounding himself into
thinking that he is Dumbledore wanting the stone back after Voldemort has been
defeated.

I point out that the book's original condition where the way to get the stone
was to not want the stone was vastly more clever.  Don't think of elephants, and
all that.

Anyway, after Voldemort gets the stone, Dumbledore shows up.

### Chapter 110 {#ch110}

Apparently Dumbledore was going to use the mirror as a trap to banish Voldemort.
But when he saw Hariezer was with him, Dumbledore sacrificed himself to save
Hariezer.  So now Dumbledore is banished somewhere.

Fair enough then.  It didn't occur to me that Riddle wouldn't take the safest
possible plan and kill Hariezer just because of the old prophecy.

### So after the big HPMOR reveal

It sort of feels like HPMOR is just the overly wordy gritty Potter reboot with
some science stuff slapped on to the first 20 chapters or so.

Like, Potter is still a horcrux, Voldemort still wanted to take take over the
wizard world and kill the muggles, etc.

Even the anti-death themes have fallen flat because of "show, don't tell"-
Dumbledore was a "deathist" but he was on the side of not killing all the
muggles, Voledmort actually defeated death but that position rides along side
the kill-everyone ethos, and Hariezer's resolution to end death apparently was
going to blow up the entire world.  So the characters might argue the positions,
but for reasons I don't comprehend, actually following through is shown as a
terrible idea.

### Anonymous: Do you ship ...

  > Do you ship any characters from HPMOR? Draco x Hermione? Quirrell x Harry?
  > Dumbledore x McGonagall? Snape x Lily?

None of the characters feel enough like real people for me to care much about
them.  The ones that feel the most "real" are the ones that are most tangential
to the story, so they just feel like their canon counterparts.

### I read the rest of HPMOR/113 puzzle

I read HPMOR, and will put chapter updates when I have time, but I wanted to put
down my version of how Hariezer will get out of the predicament at the end of
113.  I fear if I put this down after the next chapter is released, and if it's
correct, people will say I looked ahead.

Anyway, the way that this would normally be solved in HPMOR is simple the time
turner- Hariezer would resolve to go and find Mcgonagall or Bones or whoever
when this was all over and tell them to time turner into this location and bring
the heat.  Or whatever.  But that has been disallowed by the rules.

But I think Yud is setting this up as a sort of "AI box" experiment, because he
has his obsessions and they show up time and time again.  So the solution is
simply to convince Voldemort to let him go.  How?  In a version of Roko's
basilisk he needs to convince Voldemort that they might be in a simulation- i.e.
maybe they are still looking in the mirror.  Hasn't everything gone a little too
well since they first looked in?  Dumbledore was vanquished, bringing back
Hermione was practically easy, every little thing has been going perfectly.
Maybe the mirror is just simulating what he wants to see?

So two ways to go from here- Hariezer is also looking in the mirror (and he has
also gotten what he wanted, Hermione being brought back) so he might be able to
test this just by wishing for something.

Or, Hariezer can convince Voldemort that the only way to know for sure is for
Voldemort to fail to get something he wants, and the last thing he wants is for
Hariezer to die.

What did he partially transfigure?  The air into poison?   The air into a wall
between him and the death eaters?  Hell, the ground into a wall between him and
the death eaters?

Huh? How did he get it around their necks?  Nevermind, don't answer I'll find

### So I read chapter 114

And I kind of don't get how Hariezer's solution worked?  He turned the ground
near his wand into spider silk, but how did he get it around everyone's neck?
Why did he make it spider silk before turning it into nanowire?

### HPMOR Chapter 111 {#ch111}

So in this chapter, Hariezer is stripped of wand, pouch and time turner, and
Voldemort has the philosopher's stone.  It's looking pretty bad for our hero.

Voldemort walks Hariezer to an altar he has prepared,does some magic stuff, and
a new shiny body appears for him.  So now he has fully resurrected.

Voldemort then brings back Hermione (Hariezer _HAD_ stolen the remains).  I note
that I don't think Hariezer has actually _done anything_ in this entire story-
his first agenda- study magic using science- was a complete bust, and then his
second agenda was a big resolution to bring back Hermione, but Voldemort did it
for him.  Voldemort also crossed Hermione with a troll and unicorn (creating a
class Trermionecorn) so she is now basically indestructible.  Why didn't
Voldemort do this to his own body?  No idea.  Why would someone obsessed with
fighting death and pissed as hell about how long it took him to reclaim his old
body think to give _Hermione_ wolverine-level indestructibility but not himself?
Much like the letter Hariezer got to set this up, it's always bad when
characters have to behave out of character in order to set the plot up.

Anyway, to bring Hermione back Voldie gives Hariezer his wand back so he can hit
her with his super-patronus.  So he now has a wand.

Voldemort then asks Hariezer for Roger Bacon's diary (which he turns into a
Hermione horcrux), which prompts Hariezer to say

  > I tried translating a little at the beginning, but it was going slowly -"
  > Actually, it had been excruciatingly slow and Harry had found other
  > priorities.

Yep, doing experiments to discover magic, despite _being the premise of the
first 20ish chapters_ then immediately stopped being any priority at all.
Luckily it shows up here as an excuse for Hariezer to get his pouch back (he
retrieved it to get the diary).

While Voldemort is distracted making the horcrux, Hariezer whips a gun out of
the pouch and shoots Voldemort.  Something tells me it didn't work.

### HPMOR 112 {#ch112}

Not surprisingly, the shots did nothing to Voldemort who apparently can create a
wall of dirt faster than a bullet travels.  Apparently it was a trick, because
Voldemort had created some system where no Tom Riddle could kill any other Tom
Riddle unless the first had attacked him.  Somehow, Hariezer hadn't been bound
to it, and now neither of them are.

I don't know why Yudkowsky introduced this curse and then had it broken
immediately?  It would have been more interesting to force Hariezer to deal
with Voldemort without taking away his immortality.  Actually, given all the
focus on memory charms in the story, it's pretty clear that when he achieves
ultimate victory Hariezer will do it with a memory charm- turning Tom Riddle
into an immortal amnesiac or implanting other memories in him (so he is an
immortal guy who works in a restaurant or something).

In retaliation, Voldemort hits him with a spell that takes everything but his
glasses and wand, so he is naked in a graveyard, and a bunch of death eaters
teleport in (37 of them).

### Any idea how ...

Any idea how Hariezer actually got the spider silk/nanowire around the death
eater's necks? I don't understand why he gets to levitate whatever the he is
transfiguring, it's not like its rigid. He would be pushing on a string trying
to move it outward?

I think it's that thing he was practising at the Quidditch game with a pencil,
where he can control the shape of something while he's transfiguring it.

I think the climax was actually sort of in keeping with general HPMOR.  It
relied on munchkining with a previously not-really-clear magical principle (how
well CAN Hariezer shape things with transfiguration? Can he levitate them
against gravity while shaping?)  and was sort of goofy.  Which is a problem I've
discussed at length previously.   Also, the world behaved insane so that
Hariezer could win (in this case Voldemort went to great lengths to placate
Hariezer before just killing him).

I think the issue was really that he preceded the climax with a "final exam"-
which made people assume that the solution was something possible if you weren't
the dungeon master (to extend the munchkin thing).  And you could figure out the
solution with a literary analysis (the beginning does have some foreshadowing,
the power Hariezer has that no one else does is clearly partial
transfiguration,etc), but you can't have guessed at that solution as a
"rationalist" solution- but that's been true the whole time! Only the "exam"
pointed it out and spoiled the illusion.

I think Less Wrong style rationality is uniquely unsuited for generating clever

I don't do much in the way of reinventing the plot of books or movies as I
read/watch them- the story is what is presented (and in fact, tension between
the "show" and the "tell" tends to absolutely destroy my suspension of
disbelief).

Video games are another matter- the ones I played growing up had so little story
that you could fill in whatever you want.  Although a game like The Order is
really trying to be an interactive movie, so it's hard to drop in your own
interpretations.

I think my general rule is how central to the ideas being presented something
is- like the implied material science of Aperture labs doesn't really matter for
the experience, if you can suspend disbelief in that way, that's fine.  But if
there was a document laying around saying all the pillars were made of bricks,
you might have an issue (I'm thinking of Name of the Wind, where the rules of
magic introduced blatantly conflict with how he uses magic literally a paragraph
away).  Best to just introduce and not comment.

I think my problem with HPMOR is that in part its "genre savvyness" forces a lot
of fantasy conventions into sharp relief for me, and then it uses them anyway.
I wouldn't have noticed half the problems I see if the text itself didn't point
them out.

### HPMOR Chapter 113 {#ch113}

This is a short chapter, Hariezer is still in peril.    As Voldemort's death
eaters pop in, one of them tries to turn against him but Voldemort kills him
dead.

And then he forces Hariezer to swear an oath to not try to destroy the world-
Voldemort's plan is apparently to resurrect Hermione, force Hariezer to not
destroy the world, and then to kill him.  (I note that if he did things in a
slightly different order, he'd have already won...)

So this chapter ends with Hariezer surrounded by death eaters, all with wands
pointed at him, ready to kill him, and we get this (sorry, it's a long quote).

The issue here is that _literally any solution, no matter how outlandish will
work if you can design the rules to make the munchkin work._

Hariezer could use partial transfiguration to make an atomic lattice under the
earth with a few atoms of anti-matter under each death eater to blow up each of
them.

He could use the fact that Voldemort apparently cast broomstick spells on his
legs to levitate Voldemort.  And after levitating Voldemort away convince the
death eaters he is even more powerful than Voldie.

He could use the fact that _Tom Riddle_ controls the dark mark to burn all the
death eaters where they stand- Voldemort can't kill Hariezer with magic because
of the resonance, and a simple shield should stop bullets.

He could partially transfigure a dead man's switch of sorts, so that if he dies
fireworks go up and the quidditch game gets disrupted- he knows it didn't, so he
knows he won't die.

In my own solution I posted earlier, he could talk his way out using
logic-ratio-judo.  Lots of options other than my original posted solution here-
convince them that killing Hariezer makes the prophecy come true because of
science reasons,etc.

He could partially transfigure poison gas or knock out gas.

Try to come up with your own outlandish solution.  The thing is, _all of these
work_ because we don't really know the rules of HPMOR magic- we have a rough
outline, but there is still a lot of author flexibility.  So there is that.

### HPMOR 114 Solutions to the exam {#ch114}

Hariezer transfigures part of his wand into carbon nanotubes that he makes into
a net around each death eater's head and around voldemort's hands.

He uses it to decapitate all the death eaters (killing Malfoy's father almost
certainly) and taking Voldemort's hand's off.

Voldemort then charges at him but Hariezer hits him with a stunning spell.

I note that this solution is as outlandish as any.

It WAS foreshadowed in the very first chapter, but that doesn't make it less
outlandish.

So far I've only had two.   So reddit users, if you read this, I have a policy

If it's late in the day, odds are I've had a few glasses of scotch.

### Hi r/HPMOR

I read [your thread][reddit_hpmor_su_thread] , but I generally don't think it's
wise to directly comment on people discussing stuff I wrote (so I'm commenting
here, as a minor violation of the rule).

Anyway, I'm flattered that you are reading me!  Much appreciated!  Please don't
take things to seriously, I "snark" because I labor under the false impression
that I'm witty and honestly I didn't take this project particularly seriously.

I also, I apologize somewhat that someone linked me there.  I'm flattered if
anyone got any enjoyment out of my rambling, but I wouldn't want to shit on your
fun.

Also, asks are open if you have questions.

I don't normally let praise through, but I do want to say- more physics coming
soon.  If you haven't seen it my physics tag is quantum stuff.

Also, I keep saying this but I rarely get asks- please ask questions about the
physics posts if you have them.

Sure, but in the canon he was notable for being able to block Voldemort's mind
reading (which was a big deal because Voldemort was really good at it or
something.)

I think in canon, every wizard could do a bit of both?

I'm not sure it matters if he started moving to dodge, or if he started moving
to charge Hariezer?

I can understand where they are coming from though- Quirrell is used as author
mouthpiece a few times, same as Hariezer.  Even the somewhat disturbing chapter
where Hariezer learns "how to lose" is treated by the text in a pretty positive
way.

I think it's best for me to avoid inserting myself- that's your playground and
you should be free to rip me apart (or whatever the opposite is? Put me
together?) without worrying that I'm looking over your shoulder.

That said, again, I'm totally flattered people are reading me (and apparently
agreeing enough to upvote)!  And if I got any science wrong, please drop me an
ask to let me know.

Honestly?  I really didn't get that sense at all?  With the few potentially
mysterious things I can think of (Quirrell, Hariezer's dark side), we already
knew the answers from reading the original books.  I think it's dramatic irony,
not really a mystery.

### HPMOR 115-116-117 {#ch115-117}

Throughout the story, whenever there is action we then have 5-10 chapters where
everyone digests what happened.  These chapters all fit in that vein.

Hariezer rearranges the scene of his victory to put Voldemort's hands around
Hermione's neck and then rigs a big explosion.  He then time turners back to the
quidditch game (why the hell did he have time left on his time turner?)

Anyway, when he gets back to the game he does a whole "I CAN FEEL THE DARK LORD
COMING" thing, and says the Hermione followed him back.  I guess the reason for
this plot is just to keep him out of it/explain how Hermione came back?  You'd
think he could have just hung around the scene of the crime, waited 'till he was
discovered and explain what happened?

Then in chapter 117, Mcgonagall explains to the school what was found- Malfoy's
father is dead, Hermione is alive, etc.

So I just skimmed the author's note.  I don't quite get his reasoning

I do want to talk about this

The reason that is a hard sell is that it's clearly not the best way- you can
hire _actual, phd having, proven research mathematicians_ for like $50k a year
(especially the category theory type stuff MIRI has decided is important).  I
once got CS grad students at a top program to implement some code for me over a
weekend for the total cost of three cases of beer.  You can get phd _students_
even cheaper.

Direct engagement of mathematicians (possibly in exchange for money) is a far
easier way to get mathematicians for your project then to _hope_ that
rationality blogging or Harry Potter fanfiction attracts people to you.

Especially notable because it's pretty clear from MIRIs self-publications that
they have very _little actual research experience._  They don't quite read like
formal papers and they haven't even bothered to clean them up and put them on
arxiv.

My point in that chapter 78 critique is that the tone of fight club makes it
very easy to miss the point.   Just like the tone of Ender's Game made it very
easy to miss it's point.  The problem isn't with the people who came away with
the wrong idea, the problem is with the art in question.

I don't think the world is insane, I think most systems mostly work, which is
pretty impressive when you think about the scope of the civilization we live in.
Self organizing cooperation is hard, so there are going to be seams where things
don't quite line up,etc.  We can always do better and we should always be trying
to do better, but the world is remarkably sane.

First, I honestly don't understand why my critique should annoy anyone.  I've
not advertised it anywhere that the Less Wrong crowd or HPMOR fans frequent, and
I've avoided "tagging my hate" so as to not annoy the tumblr fans.  You don't
have to read me!  Lots of people find my critiques interesting, lots of people
don't.  To each their own.

Now, I want to read the whole thing because 1. I have a tick, very common in
phds, where we finish what we start.  I began the project, I'm going to finish
it. You might notice how many chapters I barely comment on, though.  2. I want
to write a complete review at the end, for which I owe it to the work to finish
it. 3. Some of my critiques of the themes may turn (although given how little is
left, that is unlikely).  4. I don't like to see bad science and bad
interpretations of science left uncorrected.  HPMOR is full of references to
interesting science, but it gets a lot of them wrong.  The fan of good pedagogy
in me finds this tremendously upsetting- tons of people have talked about how
much they learned from HPMOR and I honestly hate to think they are learning
wrong things.  In particular, the partial transfiguration bit is such a huge
misconception of what physics is that I cringe.  I want to read the rest in case
something else needs to be corrected (also unlikely, given how little is left).

Also, I think you overestimate how much effort this takes- it's mostly
off-the-cuff. I make a few notes in the margin while I read the chapter and then
write something up in one go, usually on a phone.  Hence all the typos, weird
word omissions,etc.

### Anonymous: There are now two reddit ...

I'm avoiding reading any comments on my stuff on reddit (or anywhere else
really).  If people have legitimate complaints about any of the science I bring
up, please tell me so I can edit in correct science.

Other than that, I've made my case as much as I want to.

### HPMOR chapter 118 {#ch118}

The story is still in resolution mood, and I want to point out one thing that
this story does right that the original books failed at- which is _an actual
resolution._  The one big failure of the original Harry Potter books, in my mind,
was that after Voldemort was defeated, we flashed immediately to the epilogue.
No funeral for the departed (no chance to say goodbye to the departed Fred
Weasley,etc).

Of course, in the HPMOR style, there is a huge resolution after literally every
major even in the story, so it's at least in part a stopped clock situation.

This chapter is Quirrell's funeral, which is mostly a student giving a long
eulogy (remember, Hariezer dressed things up to make it look like Quirrell died
fighting Voldemort, which is sort of true, but not the Quirrell anyone knew.)

### HPMOR Chapter 119 {#ch119}

Still in resolution mode.

Hariezer comes clean with (essentially) the order of the Phoenix members, and
tells them about how Dumbledore is trapped in the mirror.  This leads to him
receiving some letters Dumbledore left.

We find out that Dumbledore has been acting to fulfill a certain prophecy that
Hariezer plays a role in-

  > Yet in your case, Harry, and in your case alone, the prophecies of your
  > apocalypse have loopholes, though those loopholes be ever so slight.
  >
  > Always 'he will end the world', not 'he will end life'.

So I guess he'll bring in the transhumanist future.

Hariezer has also been given Dumbledore's place, which Amelia Bones is annoyed
at, so he makes her regent until he is old enough.

We also get one last weird pointless rearrangement of the canon books-
apparently Peter Pettigrew was one of those shape shifting wizards and somehow
got tricked into looking like Sirius Black.  So the wrong person has been locked
up in Azkaban.  I don't really "get" this whole Sirius/Peter were lovers/Sirius
was evil/the plot of book 3 was a schizophrenic delusion running thread (also,
Hariezer deduces, with only the evidence that there is a Black in prison and a
dead Black among the death eaters, that Peter Pettigrew was a shapeshifter, that
Peter immitated black, and that Peter is the one in Azkaban.)

And Hariezer puts a plan in place to open a hospital using the philsophers
stone, so BAM, death is defeated, at least in the wizarding world.  Unless it
turns out the stone has limits or something.

### HPMOR Chapter 120 {#ch120}

More resolution.

Hariezer comes clean to Draco about how the death eaters died.  (why did he go
to the effort of the subterfuge, if he was going to come clean to everyone
afterwards?  It just added a weird layer to all this resolution).

Draco is sad his parents are dead.  BUT, surprise- as I predicted way back when,
Dumbledore only faked Narcissa Malfoy's death and put her in magic witness
protection.


### I think one of the things ...

I think one of the things I strongly dislike about HPMOR is that there doesn't
seem to be any joy _purely in the discovery._  People have fun playing the battle
games, or fighting bullies with time turners, or generally being powerful, but
no one seems to have fun just _trying to figure things out._

For some reason (the reason is that I have a fair amount of scotch in me
actually), my brain keeps trying to put together an imprecise metaphor to old
SNES rpgs- a friend of mine in grade school loved FF2, but he always went out of
his way to find all the powerups and do all the side quests,etc.  This meant he
was always powerful enough to smash boss fights in one or two punches.  And I
always hated that- what is the fun in that? What is the challenge?  When things
got too easy, I started running from all the random encounters and stopped
buying equipment so that the boss battles were more fun.

And HPMOR feels like playing the game the first way- instead of working hard at
the fun part (discovery), you get to just use Aristotle's method (Harry Potter
and Methods of Aristotelian Science) and slap an answer down.  And that answer
makes you more powerful- you can time turner all your problems away like shooing
a misquito with a flamethrower,  when a dementor shows up you get to destroy it
just by thinking hard- no discovery required.  The story repeatedly skips the
fun part- the struggle, the learning, the discovery.

I think it's more that he needs some curiousity.  A lot of it isn't even main
plot stuff, it's just side-thinking.  Like, he deduces that that there is some
Atlantis-based-source-of-magic, but he never tries to find out if that's the
case.  He deduces that magical creatures are just cursed humans, but never tries
to verify it, never tries to study them,etc.

### HPMOR chapter 221 {#ch121}

Snape leaves hogwarts, thus completing an arc I don't think I ever cared about.

It's true.  After I criticize HPMOR I drown cute puppies in my sink, just to

### HPMOR Chapter 122 the end of the beginning {#ch122}

So unlike the canon books, the end of HPMOR sets it up more as an origin story
than a finished adventure.  After the canon books, we get the impression Harry,
Ron and Hermione settled into peaceful wizard lives.  After HPMOR, Hariezer has
set up a magical think tank to solve the problem of friendly magic, with
Hermione as his super-powered, indestructible lab assistant (tell me again how
Hariezer isn't a self insert?) , and we get the impression the real work is just
starting.

He also has the idea to found CFAR:

  > It would help if Muggles had classes for this sort of thing, but they
  > didn't. Maybe Harry could recruit Daniel Kahneman, fake his death,
  > rejuvenate him with the Stone, and put him in charge of inventing better
  > training methods...

We also learn that a more open society of idea sharing is an idea so destructive
that Hariezer's vow to end the world wouldn't let him do it:

  > Harry could look back now on the Unbreakable Vow that he'd made, and guess
  > that if not for that Vow, disaster might have already been set in motion
  > yesterday when Harry had wanted to tear down the International Statute of
  > Secrecy.

So secretive magiscience lead by Hariezer (with Hermione as super-powered
"Sparkling Unicorn Princess" side kick) will save the day, sometime in the
future.

WoG?

Also, many of Hariezer's personal anecdotes (26 hour sleep cycle, biting a
teacher,etc) are Yudkowsky's.  And Hariezer has the idea to fund wizard CFAR and
(essentially) wizard MIRI at the end of the story.

### HPMOR Full Review (draft) {#review}

I opened up a bottle of delicious older-than-me scotch when Terry Pratchett
died, and I've been enjoying it for much of this afternoon, so this will
probably be a mess and cleaned up later.

Out of 5 stars, I'd give HPMOR a 1.5.  Now, to the review (this is almost
certainly going to be long)

#### The Good

HPMOR contains some legitimately clever reworkings of the canon books to fit
with Yudkowsky's modified world:

 A few examples- In HPMOR, the "interdict of Merlin" prevents wizards from
 writing down powerful spells, so Slytherin put the Basilisk in the chamber of
 secrets to pass on his magical lore.   The prophecy "the dark lord will mark
 him as his own" was met when Voldemort gave Hariezer the same grade he himself
 had received.

Yudkowsky is also well read, and the story is peppered with reference to
legitimately interesting science.  If you google and research every reference,
you'll learn a lot.  The problem is that most of the in-story references are
incorrect, so if you don't google around you are likely to pick up dozens of
incorrect ideas.

The writing style _during action scenes_ is pretty good.  It keeps the pace
moving and brisk and can be genuinely fun to read.

#### The Bad

##### Stilted, repetitive writing

A lot of this story involves conversations that read like ham-fisted attempts at
manipulation, filled with overly stilted language.  Phrases like "Noble and Most
Ancient House," "General of Sunshine," " General of Chaos,"etc  are peppered in
over and over again.  It's just turgid.  It smooths out when events are
happening, but things are rarely happening.

##### Bad Ideas

HPMOR is full of ideas I find incredibly suspect- the only character trait worth
anything in the story (both implicitly and explicitly) is intelligence, and the
primary use of intelligence within the story is manipulation.  This leads to
cloying levels of a sort of nerd elitism.  Ron and Hagrid are basically
dismissed out of hand in this story (Ron explicitly as being useless, Hagrid
implicitly so) because they aren't intelligent enough, and Hariezer explicitly
draws implicit NPC vs real-people distinctions.

The world itself is constructed to back up these assertions- nothing in the
wizarding world makes much sense, and characters often behave in silly ways
("like NPCs") to be a foil for Hariezer.

The most ridiculous example of this is that the wizarding world justice is based
on two cornerstones- poltiicans decide guilt or innocence for all wizard crimes,
and the system of blood debts.  All of the former death eaters who were pardoned
(for claiming to be imperius cursed) apparently owe a blood debt to Hariezer,
and so as far as wizarding justice is concerned he is above the law.  He uses
this to his advantage at a trial for Hermione.

##### Bad Pedagogy

Hariezer routinely flubs the scientific concepts the reader is supposed to be
learning.  Almost all of the explicit in story science references are incorrect,
as well as being overly-jargon filled.

Some of this might be on purpose- Hariezer is supposed to be only 11. _However,_
this is terrible pedagogy.  The reader's guide to rationality is completely
unreliable.  Even weirder, the main antagonist, Voldemort, is also used as
author mouthpiece several times.  So the pedagogy is wrong at worst, and
completely unreliable at best.

And implicitly, the method Hariezer relies on for the majority of his problem
solving is Aristotelian science.  He looks at things, thinks real hard, and
knows the answer.  This is horrifyingly bad implicit pedagogy.

##### Bad Plotting

Over the course of the story, Hariezer moves from pro-active to no-active.  At
the start of the story he has a legitimate positive agenda- he wants to use
science to uncover the secrets of magic.  As the story develops, however, he
completely loses sight of that goal, and he instead becomes just a passenger in
the plot- he competes in Quirrell's games and goes through school like any other
student.  When Voldemort starts including Hariezer in his plot, Hariezer floats
along in a completely reactive way,etc.

Not until Hermione dies, near the end of the story,  does Hariezer pick up a
positive goal again (ending death) _and he does absolutely nothing to achieve
it._  He floats along reacting to everything, and Voldemort defeats death and
revives Hermione with no real input from Hariezer at all.

For a character who is supposed to be full of agency, he spends very little time
exercising it in a proactive way.

##### Nothing has consequences (boring!)

And this brings me to another problem with the plotting- _nothing in this story
has any consequences._  Nothing that goes wrong has any lasting implications for
the story at all, which makes all the evens on hand ultimately boring.  Several
examples- early in the story Hariezer uses his time turner to solve even the
simplest problems.  Snape is asking you questions about potions you don't know?
Time travel. Bullies are stealing a meaningless trinket? Time travel,etc.  As a
result of these rule violations, his time turner is locked down by Professor
Mcgonagall.  _Despite this_ Hariezer continues to use his time turner to solve
all of his problems- the plot introduces another student willing to send a time
turner message for a small amount of money via. "slytherin mail" it's even
totally anonymous.

Another egregious example of this is Quirrell's battle game- the prize for the
battle game is handed out by Quirrell in chapter 35 or so, and there are several
more battle games _after_ the prize!  The reader knows that it doesn't at all
matter who wins these games- the prize is already awarded!  What's the point?
The reader knows the prize has been given out, why are they invested in the
proceedings at all?

When Hariezer becomes indebted to Luscious Malfoy, it never constrains him in
any way. He becomes in debt, Dumbledore tells him it's bad, he does _literally
nothing_ to deal with the problem.  Two weeks later, Hermione dies and the debt
gets cancelled.

When _Hermione DIES_ Hariezer does nothing, and a few weeks later Voldemort
brings her back.  Nothing that happens _ever matters._

The closest thing to long term repercussions is Hariezer helping Bellatrix Black
escape- but we literally never see Bellatrix after that.

Hariezer never acts positively to fix his problems, he just bounces along
whining about how humans need to defeat death until his problems get solved for
him.

##### Mystery, dramatic irony and genre savvy

If you've read the canon books, you know at all times what is happening in the
story.  Voldemort has possessed Quirrell, Hariezer is a horcrux, Quirrell wants
the philsopher's stone, etc.  There are bits and pieces that are modified, but
the shape of the story is _exactly_ canon.  So all the mystery is just dramatic
irony.

This is fine, as far as it goes, but there is a huge amount of tension because
Hariezer is written as "genre savvy" and occasionally says things like "the hero
of story such-and-such would do this" or "I understand mysterious prophecies
from books."  The story is poking at cliches that the story _wholeheartedly
embraces._   Supposedly Hariezer has read enough books just like this that
_dramatic irony liked this shouldn't happen, as the story points out many times,-
he should be just as informed as the reader._  AND YET...

The author is practically screaming "wouldn't it be lazy that Harry's darkside
is because he is a horcrux?" And yet, Harry's darkside is because he is a
horcrux.

Even worse, the narration of the book takes lots of swipes at the canon plots
_while "borrowing" the plot of the books._

##### Huge Tension Between the themes/lessons and the setting

The major themes of this book are in major conflict with the setting throughout
the story.

One major theme is the need for secretive science to hide dangerous secrets-
it's echoed in the way Hariezer builds his "bayesian conspiracy," reinforced by
Hariezer and Quirrell's attitudes toward nuclear weapons (and their explicit
idea that people smart enough to build atomic weapons wouldn't use them), and
it's reinforced at the end of the novel when Hariezer's desire to dissolve some
of the secrecy around magic is thwarted by a vow he took to not-end-the-world.

Unfortunately, that same secrecy is portrayed as having stagnated the progress
of the wizarding world, and preventing magic from spreading.  That same secrecy
might well be why the wizarding world hasn't already ended death and made
thousands of philosopher's stones.

Another major theme is fighting death/no-afterlife.  _But this is a fantasy
story with magic._  There are ghosts, a gate to the afterlife, a stone to talk
to your dead loved ones,etc.  The story tries to lamp shade it a bit, but that
fundamental tension doesn't go away.  Some readers even assumed that Hariezer
was simply wrong about an afterlife in the story- because they felt the tension
and used my point above (unreliable pedagogy) to put the blame on Hariezer.   In
the story, the character _who actually ended death_ WAS ALSO THE ANTAGONIST.
Hariezer's attempts are portrayed _AS SO DANGEROUS THEY COULD END THE WORLD._

And finally- the major theme of this story is the supremacy of Bayesian
reasoning.  Unfortunately, as [nostalgebraist][nostalgebraist_tumblr] pointed
out explicitly, _a world with magic is a world where your non-magic based
Bayesian prior is worthless._ Reasoning time and time again from that prior
leads to snap conclusions unlikely to be right- _and yet in the story this works
time and time again._  Once again, the world is fighting the theme of the story
in obvious ways.

##### Let's talk about Hermoine

The most explicitly feminist arc in this story is the arc where Hermione starts
SPHEW, a group dedicated to making more wizarding heroines.  The group starts
out successful, gets in over their head, and Hariezer has to be called in to
save the day (with the help of Quirrell).

At the end of the arc, Hariezer and Dumbledore have a long conversation about
whether or not _they should have let_ Hermione and friends play their little
bully fighting game- which feels a bit like retroactively removing the
characters agency.  Sure, the women got to play at their fantasy, but only at
the whim of the real heroes.

By the end of the story, Hermione is an indestructible part-unicorn/part-troll
immortal.  And what is she going to do with this power?  Become Hariezer's lab
assistant, more or less.  Be sent on quests by him.  It just feels like Hermione
isn't really allowed to grow into her own agency in a meaningful way.

This isn't to say that it's _intentional_ (pretty much the only character with
real, proactive agency in this story is Quirrell) - but it does feel like women
get the short end of the stick here.

##### Sanderson's Law of Magic

So I've never read Sanderson, but someone point me to his first law of magic

  > Sanderson's First Law of Magics: An author's ability to solve conflict with
  > magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said
  > magic.

The idea here is that if your magic is laid out with clear rules, the author
should feel free to solve problems with it-  if your magic is mysterious and
vague like Gandolf you shouldn't solve all the conflict with magic, but if you
lay out careful rules you can have the characters magic up the occasional
solution.  I'm not sure I buy into the rule fully, but it does make a good
point- if the reader doesn't understand your magic the solution might feel like
it comes out of nowhere.

Yudkowsky never clearly lays out most of the rules of magic, and yet still
solves all his problems via magic (and magic mixed with science).  We don't know
how brooms work, but apparently if you strap one to a rocket you can actually
steer the rocket, you won't fall off the thing, and you can go way faster than
other broomsticks.

This became especially problematic when he posted his final exam- lots of
solutions were floated around each of which relied on some previously
ill-defined aspect of the magic.  Yudkowsky's own solution relied on previously
ill-defined transfiguration.

And when he isn't solving problems like that, he is relying on the time turner
over and over again.  Swatting flies with flame throwers over and over again.

Coupled with the world being written as "insane" and it just feels like it's
lazy conflict resolution.

#### Conclusion

A largely forgettable, overly long nerd power fantasy, with a bit of science
(most of it wrong) and a lot of bad ideas.  1.5 stars.

I've had a long discussion of this in the previous reviews - if Malfoy owes a
blood debt to Hariezer (for freeing him from the imperius curse) then all the
pardoned death eaters do as well.

### I decided not to edit my HPMOR review

Because fuck it, I'm done.

Interestingly enough, the exact same thing happened with my thesis.  "this is a
rough.. no wait FINAL draft."

### Hello again reddit

I guess someone else linked reddit to me- remember if your ask is just
complaining I won't let it through.  You have to ask a question.

He just tells us that shaping is a thing, we don't know if it's possible to
shape against gravity, how much he can shape, how fast, any limitations,etc.
Apparently, while you shape an object, you can levitate it against gravity, AND
non-rigid objects are rigid while the transformation is happening.

Anyway, the reason I'm responding to this one is that I want to respond to a
point a lot of people have been suggesting in my anonymous hate asks (and yours
is the most polite), I actually came into HPMOR expecting to somewhat enjoy the
story- I've read enough fantasy to enjoy deconstructions that poke a bit at the
common cliches of the fantasy genre.  If you look at my early chapter reviews,
you might see that I occasionally say things like "this is what I wanted," "this
was good, but I wanted more," etc.  I didn't expect to dislike it as much as I
did.

"It's not that Harry's dark side is a horcrux, it's that Harry is a horcrux and
that process left him with a dark side."  You realize that's just splitting
hairs, right?

Also, Voldemort _literally brought Hermione back from the dead_ with the stone.
The stone also apparently can keep someone young indefinitely.  If that isn't
"defeating death" then nothing is.

I honestly don't know enough about when non-physics science was done to know
what the story would be like if you used 90s science instead of current science.
EY didn't seem to mind using current science throughout the story, and in one
place referred to a CFAR instructor's seminar as science research for story
purposes.

I don't think you'd want to back up science by 20 years if you were writing a
pedagogical story- best to stay current.

I think I've made this comment before- but Yudkowsky is a good advocate of
ideas: if you want an argument about why Bayesianism is the best thing ever, etc
it's a fine place to find it.

However, he isn't a good guide to these ideas.  Don't expect to find the reasons
why in a lot of practical situations people don't use Bayesian methods,etc.

Alright, I've been receiving comments all day about how my reading comprehension
is terrible, and how I "don't get it" and how I'm not smart enough to "get"
HPMOR, and now I've gotten this.

Who wouldn't think Quirrell was Voldemort?  In one of his first appearances he
orchestrates a group of older students _beating the crap out of an 11 year old._
He does the whole Azkaban thing,etc.    The book screams at you about how
Quirrell is Voldemort from his first appearance onward.

I don't think I'd give Ron a grand ambition other than to combine quidditch
science with quidditch magic.  So maybe after a spell gone awry (trying to make
broomsticks that can tunnel through the opposing players or something), the
quaffle behaves like a quantum particle, and the goal keeper has problems
because they only know where it will be probablistically.  Maybe someone figures
out something like Grover's algorithm to search the arena for the snitch. I'd
have to think more about it, but the point would be quidditch "magic" as direct
analogy to quantum behavior.

Basically like Gamow's Mr. Tompkins but with quidditch.

Sure, no magic at all will violate conservation of energy if everytime there is
an imbalance you say "the energy came from magic" or "the energy went into
magic."   But you are just defining it away.

Conservation of energy is totally unrelated to faster-than-light signalling.  If
you were making magic physics, you could have local violations or non-local
physics that conserves energy.

Sure, there could always be reservoirs you don't know about, but if it seems
like you can extract energy indefinitely, something's up.  It's not like wands
seem to run down.

If information goes from A to B faster than the speed of light, it's going to be
faster than light.  This is pretty hard to observe without actual measuring
apparatus because light speed is really fast.

This seems confused "HPMOR isn't 'crack fic' but you should give it a pass
because crack fic stories also do those things."

The problem is that HPMOR tells us from all over the place that its "rational
fic" and so there is tension between the idea that we should learn from Harry
and the idea that the world is designed to be really silly so that Harry can
'win' without trying.

Honestly, that is probably the best possible outcome.  Lots of people apparently
read and like it (my positive feed back is usually "I agree with you, but I
still like HPMOR").  I'd prefer they get factual information.

I'm going to let this one through because the second sentence is pretty close to
a Big Lebowski reference.

And because I want to respond to some anonymous stuff I've been getting:

So responding to this:  I'm not going to rewrite my criticism to remove the
"snark."  I don't think I'm "signalling that I'm a member of sneer culture"
(exact quote from an ask) and I actually don't really know what that would mean.

If you don't like my writing style, fine, that's totally fair.  But it doesn't
make me wrong.

  > If you don't like it, you should have just stopped reading and STFU

How often have you seen the sentiment "I don't know why people wouldn't like
HPMOR"- that is because most people stop reading and STFU.  I guarantee you I'm
not the first person to notice all the issues with the science references  (or
the literary critique) in the story- most people didn't bother to point them out
or bring them up.

  > Stop link spamming your narcissistic trash all over reddit

I haven't once linked my stuff over reddit- that's other people who probably
liked my stuff (for the record, if you are linking me in other places, that's
totally fine, but please make it clear that you aren't the author).

I didn't like the story!  Surely if you want people to talk about how awesome
the story is you can find people that loved it all over the place.

I readily admit I did not take my project very seriously.  It was just a goofy

So he posted a comment about he deliberately didn't read me?  I mean, that is

Do you think there is a place for negative reviews of things?  Should negative

So I'm not the arbiter of taste (as much as I might say otherwise if I've had a
few drinks).  I can't tell you that the stories bad objectively outweighs the
good.  For me, the things I disliked were very strong.

There is a [famous essay][the_two_cultures_wiki] by CP Snow that asserts that
intellectual life is split into two cultures, humanities and science.
Throughout college and my phd program I was surrounded by people who insist that
this division is obviously good, and that science culture » humanities culture.
This comes with a lot of other baggage (since science culture is smaller, most
people are "sheeple," etc).  I think these ideas are 1. deeply entrenched in
"science" culture 2. harmful and wrong.

Because of this, I'm _deeply_ distrustful of things that strongly reinforce
these sorts of ideas (implicitly and explicitly).  I'm also _deeply_ distrustful
of the "think real hard -> your problem is solved" methodology that appears time
and time again in HPMOR.  It's dressing up deeply unscientific behavior as the
ultimate in scientific behavior.

So for me, these issues were always going to overshadow the good in HPMOR.  But
for you, they obviously didn't.  _And that's fine._  People have different
tastes.

As for whether it's a "force of good," I think that might be to strong.  I think
it's been a piece of writing some people found entertaining and some people
didn't that is probably ultimately neutral in the world of ideas and literature.

### Inference!

I took the text of some of my asks and chucked them into a quick statistical
model.  They divide pretty neatly into 3 clusters, which also coincide with the
day they came in.

So if an ask contains the words "sneer" it came in today with pretty high
probability.  No one had used that word much before.  So someone linked me with
the word sneer I guess.

The word snark signals pretty strongly you came in before I wrote my full
review.  You also are likely to have used "uncharitable," "geek porn" and
"efficient market hypothesis."  I have literally no explanation for those
particular words, maybe they were mentioned by whoever linked me.

The word "examples" (always complaining about how I gave no examples) came in a
day after I wrote my full review, I think someone must have linked to only the
full review and the people bitching found the ask button before the "my methods
of rationality series" link.  These people also were likely to use Hermione,
asshat, fridge, and EY (always suggesting I'm secretly EY).

There is a very small fourth cluster that asked troll questions about gamergate,
rape, reverse racism,etc.

### Anonymous: Would be really interested ...

  > because that would be cool.

I moved the data to a file in the most low tech way possible (copy/paste).
Since I was reading them, I flagged a few phrases (i.e. efficient market
hypothesis) I wanted to keep as one token.

After that I ran it through some python code I originally wrote for a client, so
I can't be too specific- but it does a tiny bit of stemming, removes a set list
of words (my own list of stop words, basically), after that, each word's
existence sets a flag, so you get big vectors of 1s and 0s for which words are
present/not present, and then finds clusters by

1.  randomly putting down some cluster centers

2. finding which center is closest to each data point and assigning the point to
that cluster

3. calculate the center of each cluster, and move the central point of the
cluster to the new center.

Rinse and repeat

To calculate the distance between points, you could just use the euclidean
distance but I use a few things I've found to be slight improvements.

I also have some "goodness of fit" metrics on how well the points are clustered.
So it calculates first with 2 clusters, checks goodness of fit, then 3,etc.  And
it stops adding new clusters when the fit stops improving.

### Anonymous: Who cares if the science ...

The big problem is that Yudkowsky asserts over and over that all the science is
correct.

If he said "I tried to make all the science correct, but I'm no expert," then
sure, I'd agree with you.

Several people have recommended Ra, Worm and Harry Potter and the Natural d20 to

But honestly, other than a few one-off "I didn't like this" sort of reviews
(that are on sites dedicated to Harry Potter fanfic) literally no one but me
seems to have put any time into looking at HPMOR on it's own term, and
discussing the science and themes.  There is no sneer culture, there is just
"sneer me" I guess.

I'm not suggesting EY has to read this, or even that he should.   I don't think
anyone has to read it (which is why I didn't link it to the subreddit).  But
pointing out that my review exists while also claiming it's a bad, ugly, sneery
sneerfest isn't exactly doing my ask box any good.

And it's not like he hasn't heard the same criticism before.  Here is a reddit
thread I got sent by fan mail with my same criticism from 2 years ago:

[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/19z9sw/help_understanding_harrys_rant_in_ch2/](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/19z9sw/help_understanding_harrys_rant_in_ch2/)

So I want to point out that HIV denialists are always hurting/'bothering'
people.

A family friend's daughter passed away because HIV denialist literature
convinced her not to take medicine to protect her daughter.  She then passed
away not long after.

She wasn't aggressively converted, she got her diagnosis, paniced, and turned to
the internet for advice.

There are real consequences to those terrible ideas.

I don't know if sneering at them/making them feel stupid helps rid people of the
ideas (it probably doesn't), but we should be doing everything in our power to
clear out the ideas.

You must not have ever lived in a red state.  Yes, the "red tribe" bashes
hippies, sissies, "hard-leftists," commies, etc.

My friend pulled his kid from public school, because she said something about
global warming and the teacher made fun of her.

### Blessed Silence

I awoke to 0 asks about HPMOR.  First time in nearly a week.

I'm indifferent, I didn't really enjoy either work.  Hopefully in the future all
high schoolers of above-average intelligence read Pratchett or something more
fun.

I sort of doubt you actually know the guy, but that is the impression I get.

I'm sort of trying to stay off the r/hpmor type forums, because the last thing I
need or want is to get into arguments on reddit.  I assume this is whatever

It's not that the story barely uses the scientific method- it's that the story
consistently uses Aristotelian methods (think hard -> be right), which are
pretty much the opposite of the scientific method, all while claiming to be
didactic fiction. The lesson it's teaching is that science is for suckers, real
men think hard and then win.  Heck, the only time science is tried, it fails so
Harry gives up on science and just starts thinking hard.

Also, read this again:

The story ends with Harry gaining power over Hogwarts, magical Britain, and
essentially the world. He can overcome death, manufacture unlimited quantities
of gold or anything else, and he has collected the complete set of the strongest
magical artefacts and an immortal hybrid unicorn/troll sidekick. That isn't a
focus on reality it's a focus on wish fulfillment!  That is why its the "typical
outcome of a poorly-run D&D campaign."

Oh, I mean, I think generally a lot of stuff sits in that niche.  Schlock genre
sci-fi and fantasy, etc.

I'd rather have Rand over HPMOR honestly, because I get super frustrated about
people not understanding how science works :)

The first thing that pops into my head is rationalwiki.  I've been linked to
their posts by people as "OMG, how terrible!" and I always think it's actually a
pretty fair (though biased) piece.  Or at least it was several months ago when I
read it, it's a wiki so that is a moving target.

And I think sneering would be only talking about Draco's rape threat, or only
talking about the chapter where a group of 18 year olds beat up an 11 year old
at the behest of a teacher after a class.  Taking one piece out of context, and
talking about it's ridiculousness, and nothing else.

I took HPMOR for exactly what it claimed to be, I read the entire thing.  I
pointed out the many times it gets the science completely wrong, and the themes
and ideas I found suspect.  I took it for the didactic fiction it claimed to be
and demonstrated the problems I had.  Yes, I mocked the fact that Harry was an
obvious self-insert with a childish portmanteu.  But it's too much to ask for a
critic to take the story seriously and write a fair critique _AND TO USE A TONE
YOU APPROVE OF.  I didn't like the story.  I'm not going to pretend I was
dispassionate about it._

And I doubt I'm the first person to notice all these problems with the science-
I'm just the only person who seems to have taken the story seriously enough to
_actually care._

I also think all the people complaining about my tone should avoid going into
science or research, where arguments are far more contentious.

But what are you really hoping to get here?  In a positive review, you'd
probably find someone saying "I LOVED this chapter. I was shaking with
excitement" or "I wept tears of joy," or other such.  In a negative review you
might find sentiments like "I was rolling my eyes,"  "this was viscerally
upsetting," etc.

I didn't like the story.  If your friends don't want to read negative reviews of
HPMOR that is fine, but negative reviews are going to be, you know, negative.

Edit: this isn't rhetorical. Seriously, what are you expecting to get here?

I really didn't like the story.  I'm sorry that there aren't any more neutral
reviews for you.  I try to make my point of view clear, so people know where I'm
coming from.

BUT, and this is important, I also try to be fair.  I correct mistakes where I
think I've made them and I try to treat the story on the terms it sets for
itself.

I don't know.  I didn't know The Science of Discworld was a thing until right
now. I wonder how the accuracy of "The Science of Discworld" compares to HPMOR.
Probably better (discounting the fact that it's from 99)

I do agree that transhumanists basically recreated christianity, and I did note
in my reviews that the Potter's motto was from Corinthians.

I didn't realize it was also on the tombstones in the original books, probably
there it wasn't a "family motto," Yudkowsky must have seen it and not realized
it was a biblical quote, turned it into a family motto.

I'm actually going to edit a bit about this into my chapter 96.

?  Mostly I've criticized HPMOR?  Might be helpful if you actually point to
something I said that offended you?

### HPMOR timeline

I'm done with HPMOR, the story is over,etc.  If you notice problems that need
correcting, or are like that anon that said I "accused Yudkowsky" of something
or just feel the need to yell at me, you have until the end of the weekend.
After that, asks about HPMOR will be summarily deleted.

### Anonymous: Is Harry James ...

Not really?  He is an incurious and a huge twerp.  And he is constantly making
wrong references to cognitive biases and scientific ideas, so he has an
unfounded arrogance.  That doesn't make him a sociopath, just an asshole.

Instead of Harriezer I would have used Potkowsky.

### I read the three reddit posts I found on my HPMOR review

I figured enough time had passed that I wouldn't feel the urge to comment or
defend myself.  Luckily, not much to defend myself against (other than people
complaining about tone)- it seems no one really disagrees with me about the
bad/wrong/misused science,etc.  So rest assured, my cutting edge criticism was
r/HPMOR vetted.

### Walking on a college campus today...

Overheard someone recommend my blog to someone reading HPMOR.  I HAVE ARRIVED.

I'm almost certainly done with rationalist fiction.

  > Yudkowsky is shit talking you on reddit HPMOR. Says all your science

I've said this before, but the HPMOR subreddit is clearly supposed to be for
fans.  I'm not going to go and crap all over it.  I didn't like the story,
that's not my forum.

I've always said that I will correct any science I've gotten wrong if someone
brings it to my attention.  If you look at [my hpmor reviews](#), you'll see
I've made edits and corrections where I was mistaken.  I'm not an expert in all
things, I'll obviously get some things wrong.

If anyone, Yudkowsky included, wants me to edit mistakes they merely have to
point out where I'm mistaken.  I leave anon asks open, in part, because I don't
want to cut off that avenue.

### Anonymous: Yudkowsky's shitposting about ...

  > Yudkowsky's shitposting about you keeps getting worse. It's basically

I can understand your desire to stir up drama on reddit.  But what would it
accomplish?  I saw [the comment in
question][uncrediblehallq_yudkowsky_reddit_shitposting], does it really seem
like I'm going to accomplish something by engaging?

[Back in chapter 20](#chapter-20--why-is-this-chapter-called-bayes-theorem) I
criticized Quirrell's crap use of Bayes theorem to justify jumping to a
conclusion.  Yudkowsky is doing the same thing.  He hasn't read any of my work
but he decided

1. It's super hard to find science errors, so his prior that anything I found is
   low.  So his prior for "is making this up" is high.
2. Every mistake or criticism mentioned then "supports" the fact that I'm making
   it up.

There is no evidence that can move that opinion, so there is really no point in
going in there and causing a shitstorm.

You can learn to reason just like Yudkowsky in that comment directly from HPMOR.
Which is why I thought I needed to write a long thing about HPMOR.

I guess I feel like I made my points as clearly as I could in my original
reviews.  I don't know what I can do other than just keep repeating stuff I've
already said.

And also,  if people create a community around their love of a story, I really
don't think it's my place to run in and throw my weight around yelling about how
bad the things is.  I've kept my opinions isolated in their own little tumblr,
and I feel confident enough in what I've written that I think the posts speak
pretty well on their own.

Several people have told me that a lot of the r/HPMOR community agrees with many
of my points, and that is great.  I feel like I've accomplished something if
people are saying "ok, I still love this story, it's fantastic, BUT now I can
see why someone might react differently." And I don't think I could have
achieved that if I didn't let the community read the posts and come to their own
opinions without me sitting over their shoulder yelling "SEE? SEE WHAT I MEAN?"
